Teacher Support The photo of the Andromeda galaxy and its subsequent mentioned in this chapter is meant to show students that the same laws of physics apply to extremely large systems, such as a galaxy, and apply also to smaller systems in our universe. The same laws that govern the movement of the stars within the Andromeda galaxy also explain the gravitational forces on Earth that all humans experience and interact with every second of their lives.Take a look at the image above of the Andromeda Galaxy (), which contains billions of stars. This galaxy is the nearest one to our own galaxy (the Milky Way) but is still a staggering 2.5 million light years from Earth. (A light year is a measurement of the distance light travels in a year.) Yet, the primary force that affects the movement of stars within Andromeda is the same force that we contend with here on Earth—namely, gravity.

Section Key Terms atom classical physics modern physics physics quantum mechanics theory of relativity Teacher Support To help meet the multimodal needs of classrooms today, OpenStax Tutor’s Physics provides Teacher Support tips for on-level [OL], below-level [BL], and above-level [AL] students. [OL]Pre-assessment for this section could involve asking students the definition of matter, atoms, electrons, protons, neutrons, subatomic particles, and energy. Students could also be asked to name some prominent classical and modern physicists and to describe some of their work in general terms. [OL]The introduction and opening picture are meant to show students that the physical laws governing their own everyday surroundings also govern the movement of stars in a galaxy. Teachers could ask students how gravity affects life on Earth. Students will likely mention how gravity keeps us on Earth’s surface. Prompt them, if necessary, to also think about Earth’s orbital motion around the sun. This motion allows Earth to bask in the warmth of the sun’s light. Without the Sun’s gravity, Earth would continue moving in a straight line and move away from the sun, while people would float off of Earth’s surface. The orbit of the moon could also be brought into this discussion, because Earth’s gravity keeps the moon moving around Earth rather than continuing in a straight path. What Physics IsThink about all of the technological devices that you use on a regular basis. Computers, wireless internet, smart phones, tablets, global positioning system (GPS), MP3 players, and satellite radio might come to mind. Next, think about the most exciting modern technologies that you have heard about in the news, such as trains that levitate above their tracks, invisibility cloaks that bend light around them, and microscopic robots that fight diseased cells in our bodies. All of these groundbreaking advancements rely on the principles of physics. Physics is a branch of science. The word science comes from a Latin word that means having knowledge, and refers to the knowledge of how the physical world operates, based on objective evidence determined through observation and experimentation. A key requirement of any scientific explanation of a natural phenomenon is that it must be testable; one must be able to devise and conduct an experimental investigation that either supports or refutes the explanation. It is important to note that some questions fall outside the realm of science precisely because they deal with phenomena that are not scientifically testable. This need for objective evidence helps define the investigative process scientists follow, which will be described later in this chapter. Physics is the science aimed at describing the fundamental aspects of our universe. This includes what things are in it, what properties of those things are noticeable, and what processes those things or their properties undergo. In simpler terms, physics attempts to describe the basic mechanisms that make our universe behave the way it does. For example, consider a smart phone (). Physics describes how electric current interacts with the various circuits inside the device. This knowledge helps engineers select the appropriate materials and circuit layout when building the smart phone. Next, consider a GPS. Physics describes the relationship between the speed of an object, the distance over which it travels, and the time it takes to travel that distance. When you use a GPS device in a vehicle, it utilizes these physics relationships to determine the travel time from one location to another. Physics describes the way that electric charge flows through the circuits of this device. Engineers use their knowledge of physics to construct a smartphone with features that consumers will enjoy, such as a GPS function. GPS uses physics equations to determine the driving time between two locations on a map. (@gletham GIS, Social, Mobile Tech Images) Teacher Support [AL]Ask what parts of a cell phone should contain conducting materials (wires, circuit boards, etc.) versus insulating materials (e.g., places where electrical insulation keeps humans from touching electrical circuits inside the phone). [AL]You can delve into GPS usage at this point by defining velocity = distance/time, discussing triangulation, and/or discussing line of sight. As our technology evolved over the centuries, physics expanded into many branches. Ancient peoples could only study things that they could see with the naked eye or otherwise experience without the aid of scientific equipment. This included the study of kinematics, which is the study of moving objects. For example, ancient people often studied the apparent motion of objects in the sky, such as the sun, moon, and stars. This is evident in the construction of prehistoric astronomical observatories, such as Stonehenge in England (shown in ). Stonehenge is a monument located in England that was built between 3000 and 1000 B.C. It functions as an ancient astronomical observatory, with certain rocks in the monument aligning with the position of the sun during the summer and winter solstices. Other rocks align with the rising and setting of the moon during certain days of the year. (Citypeek, Wikimedia Commons) Ancient people also studied statics and dynamics, which focus on how objects start moving, stop moving, and change speed and direction in response to forces that push or pull on the objects. This early interest in kinematics and dynamics allowed humans to invent simple machines, such as the lever, the pulley, the ramp, and the wheel. These simple machines were gradually combined and integrated to produce more complicated machines, such as wagons and cranes. Machines allowed humans to gradually do more work more effectively in less time, allowing them to create larger and more complicated buildings and structures, many of which still exist today from ancient times. As technology advanced, the branches of physics diversified even more. These include branches such as acoustics, the study of sound, and optics, the study of the light. In 1608, the invention of the telescope by a German spectacle maker, Hans Lippershey, led to huge breakthroughs in astronomythe study of objects or phenomena in space. One year later, in 1609, Galileo Galilei began the first studies of the solar system and the universe using a telescope. During the Renaissance era, Isaac Newton used observations made by Galileo to construct his three laws of motion. These laws were the standard for studying kinematics and dynamics even today. Another major branch of physics is thermodynamics, which includes the study of thermal energy and the transfer of heat. James Prescott Joule, an English physicist, studied the nature of heat and its relationship to work. Joule’s work helped lay the foundation for the first of three laws of thermodynamics that describe how energy in our universe is transferred from one object to another or transformed from one form to another. Studies in thermodynamics were motivated by the need to make engines more efficient, keep people safe from the elements, and preserve food. The 18th and 19th centuries also saw great strides in the study of electricity and magnetism. Electricity involves the study of electric charges and their movements. Magnetism had long ago been noticed as an attractive force between a magnetized object and a metal like iron, or between the opposite poles (North and South) of two magnetized objects. In 1820, Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted showed that electric currents create magnetic fields. In 1831, English inventor Michael Faraday showed that moving a wire through a magnetic field could induce an electric current. These studies led to the inventions of the electric motor and electric generator, which revolutionized human life by bringing electricity and magnetism into our machines.The end of the 19th century saw the discovery of radioactive substances by the scientists Marie and Pierre Curie. Nuclear physics involves studying the nuclei of atoms, the source of nuclear radiation. In the 20th century, the study of nuclear physics eventually led to the ability to split the nucleus of an atom, a process called nuclear fission. This process is the basis for nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons. Also, the field of quantum mechanics, which involves the mechanics of atoms and molecules, saw great strides during the 20th century as our understanding of atoms and subatomic particles increased (see below).Early in the 20th century, Albert Einstein revolutionized several branches of physics, especially relativity. Relativity revolutionized our understanding of motion and the universe in general as described further in this chapter. Now, in the 21st century, physicists continue to study these and many other branches of physics. By studying the most important topics in physics, you will gain analytical abilities that will enable you to apply physics far beyond the scope of what can be included in a single book. These analytical skills will help you to excel academically, and they will also help you to think critically in any career you choose to pursue. Physics: Past and Present The word physics is thought to come from the Greek word phusis, meaning nature. The study of nature later came to be called natural philosophy. From ancient times through the Renaissance, natural philosophy encompassed many fields, including astronomy, biology, chemistry, mathematics, and medicine. Over the last few centuries, the growth of scientific knowledge has resulted in ever-increasing specialization and branching of natural philosophy into separate fields, with physics retaining the most basic facets. Physics, as it developed from the Renaissance to the end of the 19th century, is called classical physics. Revolutionary discoveries starting at the beginning of the 20th century transformed physics from classical physics to modern physics. Teacher Support [BL][EL]English learners may need philosophy and classical defined during this section. Relate the definition of classical physics to the use of the word classical in a context that is probably more familiar to students, such as classic films. Classical physics is not an exact description of the universe, but it is an excellent approximation under the following conditions: (1) matter must be moving at speeds less than about 1 percent of the speed of light, (2) the objects dealt with must be large enough to be seen with the naked eye, and (3) only weak gravity, such as that generated by Earth, can be involved. Very small objects, such as atoms and molecules, cannot be adequately explained by classical physics. These three conditions apply to almost all of everyday experience. As a result, most aspects of classical physics should make sense on an intuitive level. Teacher Support [OL]To better relate to student experience, express the speed of light in units used while driving a car, for example, 1.080 million km/h or 671 million miles per hour. Relate this to the approximately eight minute trip that light takes to travel 150 billion kilometers (93 billion miles) from the Sun to the Earth. Many laws of classical physics have been modified during the 20th century, resulting in revolutionary changes in technology, society, and our view of the universe. As a result, many aspects of modern physics, which occur outside of the range of our everyday experience, may seem bizarre or unbelievable. So why is most of this textbook devoted to classical physics? There are two main reasons. The first is that knowledge of classical physics is necessary to understand modern physics. The second reason is that classical physics still gives an accurate description of the universe under a wide range of everyday circumstances. Modern physics includes two revolutionary theories: relativity and quantum mechanics. These theories deal with the very fast and the very small, respectively. The theory of relativity was developed by Albert Einstein in 1905. By examining how two observers moving relative to each other would see the same phenomena, Einstein devised radical new ideas about time and space. He came to the startling conclusion that the measured length of an object travelling at high speeds (greater than about one percent of the speed of light) is shorter than the same object measured at rest. Perhaps even more bizarre is the idea that the time for the same process to occur is different depending on the motion of the observer. Time passes more slowly for an object travelling at high speeds. A trip to the nearest star system, Alpha Centauri, might take an astronaut 4.5 Earth years if the ship travels near the speed of light. However, because time is slowed at higher speeds, the astronaut would age only 0.5 years during the trip. Einstein’s ideas of relativity were accepted after they were confirmed by numerous experiments. Gravity, the force that holds us to Earth, can also affect time and space. For example, time passes more slowly on Earth’s surface than for objects farther from the surface, such as a satellite in orbit. The very accurate clocks on global positioning satellites have to correct for this. They slowly keep getting ahead of clocks at Earth’s surface. This is called time dilation, and it occurs because gravity, in essence, slows down time. Teacher Support [AL]By saying that time passes more slowly at near-light speeds or high gravity, it is important to mention that people in both locations perceive the second as the same length of time. Large objects, like Earth, have strong enough gravity to distort space. To visualize this idea, think about a bowling ball placed on a trampoline. The bowling ball depresses or curves the surface of the trampoline. If you rolled a marble across the trampoline, it would follow the surface of the trampoline, roll into the depression caused by the bowling ball, and hit the ball. Similarly, the Earth curves space around it in the shape of a funnel. These curves in space due to the Earth cause objects to be attracted to Earth (i.e., gravity). Because of the way gravity affects space and time, Einstein stated that gravity affects the space-time continuum, as illustrated in . This is why time proceeds more slowly at Earth’s surface than in orbit. In black holes, whose gravity is hundreds of times that of Earth, time passes so slowly that it would appear to a far-away observer to have stopped! Einstein’s theory of relativity describes space and time as an interweaved mesh. Large objects, such as a planet, distort space, causing objects to fall in toward the planet due to the action of gravity. Large objects also distort time, causing time to proceed at a slower rate near the surface of Earth compared with the area outside of the distorted region of space-time. Teacher Support [AL]Black holes are much more dense and massive than Earth. The greater an object’s mass, the stronger the gravitational field it produces, and the more that gravity slows down time. In summary, relativity says that in describing the universe, it is important to realize that time, space and speed are not absolute. Instead, they can appear different to different observers. Einstein’s ability to reason out relativity is even more amazing because we cannot see the effects of relativity in our everyday lives. Quantum mechanics is the second major theory of modern physics. Quantum mechanics deals with the very small, namely, the subatomic particles that make up atoms. Atoms () are the smallest units of elements. However, atoms themselves are constructed of even smaller subatomic particles, such as protons, neutrons and electrons. Quantum mechanics strives to describe the properties and behavior of these and other subatomic particles. Often, these particles do not behave in the ways expected by classical physics. Using a scanning tunneling microscope (STM), scientists can see the individual atoms that compose this sheet of gold. (Erwinrossen)Teacher Support [OL][AL]Assess prior knowledge of subatomic particles by asking students if they have heard of protons, electrons, neutrons, as well as quarks, Higgs-Boson particles, and so on. [AL]Scanning electron microscopes generate highly-detailed surface views of objects such as that shown in . They scan the object’s surface with beams of electrons to detect the object’s microscopic topography.At particle colliders (), such as the Large Hadron Collider on the France-Swiss border, particle physicists can make subatomic particles travel at very high speeds within a 27 kilometers (17 miles) long superconducting tunnel. They can then study the properties of the particles at high speeds, as well as collide them with each other to see how they exchange energy. This has led to many intriguing discoveries such as the Higgs-Boson particle, which gives matter the property of mass, and antimatter, which causes a huge energy release when it comes in contact with matter. Particle colliders such as the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland or Fermilab in the United States (pictured here), have long tunnels that allows subatomic particles to be accelerated to near light speed. (Andrius.v )Physicists are currently trying to unify the two theories of modern physics, relativity and quantum mechanics, into a single, comprehensive theory called relativistic quantum mechanics. Relating the behavior of subatomic particles to gravity, time, and space will allow us to explain how the universe works in a much more comprehensive way. Application of Physics You need not be a scientist to use physics. On the contrary, knowledge of physics is useful in everyday situations as well as in nonscientific professions. For example, physics can help you understand why you shouldn’t put metal in the microwave (), why a black car radiator helps remove heat in a car engine, and why a white roof helps keep the inside of a house cool. The operation of a car’s ignition system, as well as the transmission of electrical signals through our nervous system, are much easier to understand when you think about them in terms of the basic physics of electricity. Why can't you put metal in the microwave? Microwaves are high-energy radiation that increases the movement of electrons in metal. These moving electrons can create an electrical current, causing sparking that can lead to a fire. (= MoneyBlogNewz) Teacher Support [AL]It is hazardous to put metal in the microwave because metal reflects microwaves, which, when free to bounce around the oven, can damage the oven. Also, the metal in the microwave oven gets very hot and begins generating an electrical field. This electrical field ionizes the air surrounding the metal, creating sparks. Physics is the foundation of many important scientific disciplines. For example, chemistry deals with the interactions of atoms and molecules. Not surprisingly, chemistry is rooted in atomic and molecular physics. Most branches of engineering are also applied physics. In architecture, physics is at the heart of determining structural stability, acoustics, heating, lighting, and cooling for buildings. Parts of geology, the study of nonliving parts of Earth, rely heavily on physics; including radioactive dating, earthquake analysis, and heat transfer across Earth’s surface. Indeed, some disciplines, such as biophysics and geophysics, are hybrids of physics and other disciplines. Teacher Support [BL][EL]Students may need acoustics to be explained as the properties of a room or structure that determine how sound is transmitted within it. Physics also describes the chemical processes that power the human body. Physics is involved in medical diagnostics, such as x-rays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasonic blood flow measurements (). Physics also has many applications in biology, the study of life. For example, physics describes how cells can protect themselves using their cell walls and cell membranes (). Medical therapy sometimes directly involves physics, such as in using X-rays to diagnose health conditions. Physics can also explain what we perceive with our senses, such as how the ears detect sound or the eye detects color. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses electromagnetic waves to yield an image of the brain, which doctors can use to find diseased regions. (Rashmi Chawla, Daniel Smith, and Paul E. Marik) Physics, chemistry, and biology help describe the properties of cell walls in plant cells, such as the onion cells seen here. (Umberto Salvagnin) Teacher Support [BL]Cell membranes (found in the cells of all organisms) control the transport of materials into and out of a cell. Cell walls (found in plant cells, fungus cells, bacteria, and plant-like microbes) mainly provide structure and support. [AL]X-rays easily penetrate skin and soft tissues but are absorbed to a far greater extent by bone. This produces an image where bones within the body are clearly visible while soft tissue is not. MRI scans for the magnetic properties of atoms within the body, allowing the solid versus empty areas within the body to be visualized. Ultrasonic blood flow measurements use sound waves and the Doppler effect to measure blood flow speed and volume. The Physics of Landing on a Comet On November 12, 2014, the European Space Agency’s Rosetta spacecraft (shown in ) became the first ever to reach and orbit a comet. Shortly after, Rosetta’s rover, Philae, landed on the comet, representing the first time humans have ever landed a space probe on a comet. The Rosetta spacecraft, with its large and revolutionary solar panels, carried the Philae lander to a comet. The lander then detached and landed on the comet’s surface. (European Space Agency)After traveling 6.4 billion kilometers starting from its launch on Earth, Rosetta landed on the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, which is only 4 kilometers wide. Physics was needed to successfully plot the course to reach such a small, distant, and rapidly moving target. Rosetta’s path to the comet was not straight forward. The probe first had to travel to Mars so that Mars’s gravity could accelerate it and divert it in the exact direction of the comet. This was not the first time humans used gravity to power our spaceships. Voyager 2, a space probe launched in 1977, used the gravity of Saturn to slingshot over to Uranus and Neptune (illustrated in ), providing the first pictures ever taken of these planets. Now, almost 40 years after its launch, Voyager 2 is at the very edge of our solar system and is about to enter interstellar space. Its sister ship, Voyager 1 (illustrated in ), which was also launched in 1977, is already there.To listen to the sounds of interstellar space or see images that have been transmitted back from the Voyager I or to learn more about the Voyager mission, visit the Voyager’s Mission website. a) Voyager 2, launched in 1977, used the gravity of Saturn to slingshot over to Uranus and Neptune. NASA b) A rendering of Voyager 1, the first space probe to ever leave our solar system and enter interstellar space. NASABoth Voyagers have electrical power generators based on the decay of radioisotopes. These generators have served them for almost 40 years. Rosetta, on the other hand, is solar-powered. In fact, Rosetta became the first space probe to travel beyond the asteroid belt by relying only on solar cells for power generation. At 800 million kilometers from the sun, Rosetta receives sunlight that is only 4 percent as strong as on Earth. In addition, it is very cold in space. Therefore, a lot of physics went into developing Rosetta’s low-intensity low-temperature solar cells. In this sense, the Rosetta project nicely shows the huge range of topics encompassed by physics: from modeling the movement of gigantic planets over huge distances within our solar systems, to learning how to generate electric power from low-intensity light. Physics is, by far, the broadest field of science. What characteristics of the solar system would have to be known or calculated in order to send a probe to a distant planet, such as Jupiter? the effects due to the light from the distant stars the effects due to the air in the solar system the effects due to the gravity from the other planets the effects due to the cosmic microwave background radiation Teacher Support This passage describes the physics behind getting the Rosetta and Voyager probes across the solar system using gravitational sling shots. In addition, the physics behind the power systems of these probes is compared. This is meant to reinforce how physics applies over wide ranges, from the immense distances in our universe to the tiny sizes of subatomic particles. Answers to the Grasp Check may vary. A sample answer: You would have to how the target planet moves to know when to launch the probe so it actually reaches the planet. You would also need to know and account for the effects of gravity from other planets during the path followed during its journey. In summary, physics studies many of the most basic aspects of science. A knowledge of physics is, therefore, necessary to understand all other sciences. This is because physics explains the most basic ways in which our universe works. However, it is not necessary to formally study all applications of physics. A knowledge of the basic laws of physics will be most useful to you, so that you can use them to solve some everyday problems. In this way, the study of physics can improve your problem-solving skills. Check Your Understanding Which of the following is not an essential feature of scientific explanations?

Matter is moving at great speeds, comparable to the speed of light. Objects are just large enough to be visible through the most powerful telescope. Only weak gravitational fields are involved. Why is the Greek word for nature appropriate in describing the field of physics? Physics is a natural science that studies life and living organism on habitable planets like Earth.

If students are struggling with a specific objective, the Check Your Understanding will help identify the source of the problem and direct students to the relevant content. Section Summary Physics is the most fundamental of the sciences, concerning itself with energy, matter, space and time, and their interactions. Modern physics involves the theory of relativity, which describes how time, space and gravity are not constant in our universe can be different for different observers, and quantum mechanics, which describes the behavior of subatomic particles. Physics is the basis for all other sciences, such as chemistry, biology and geology, because physics describes the fundamental way in which the universe functions. Concept Items Which of the following is not an underlying assumption essential to scientific understanding? Characteristics of the physical universe can be perceived and objectively measured by human beings. Explanations of natural phenomena can be established with absolute certainty. Fundamental physical processes dictate how characteristics of the physical universe evolve. The fundamental processes of nature operate the same way everywhere and at all times. The correct answer is (b). Scientific explanations may be fully supported by all existing evidence, and so accepted as highly probable and extremely useful for practical applications. But science never precludes the possibility that some future observation could contradict the explanation, requiring a modification to the existing explanation or an entirely new explanation. Which of the following questions regarding a strain of genetically modified rice is not one that can be answered by science? How does the yield of the genetically modified rice compare with that of existing rice? Is the genetically modified rice more resistant to infestation than existing rice? How does the nutritional value of the genetically modified rice compare to that of existing rice? Should the genetically modified rice be grown commercially and sold in the marketplace? The correct answer is (d). How one weighs the benefits and risks of introducing genetically modified organisms into the food chain (and nature in general) involves subjective judgment that can vary widely from person to person. Science can contribute information regarding the relative benefits and risks, but it does not make conclusive judgments about how scientific knowledge should be used. Answers to the remaining three questions can be decided based strictly on observations and the results of experimentation, and so can be answered by science. What conditions imply that we can use classical physics without considering special relativity or quantum mechanics? matter is moving at speeds of less than roughly 1 percent the speed of light, objects are large enough to be seen with the naked eye, and there is the involvement of a strong gravitational field. matter is moving at speeds greater than roughly 1 percent the speed of light, objects are large enough to be seen with the naked eye, and there is the involvement of a strong gravitational field. matter is moving at speeds of less than roughly 1 percent the speed of light, objects are too small to be seen with the naked eye, and there is the involvement of only a weak gravitational field. matter is moving at speeds of less than roughly 1 percent the speed of light, objects are large enough to be seen with the naked eye, and there is the involvement of a weak gravitational field. Why is Einsteins theory of relativity considered part of modern physics, as opposed to classical physics? Because it was considered less outstanding than the classics of physics, such as classical mechanics. Because it was popular physics enjoyed by average people today, instead of physics studied by the elite. Because the theory deals with very slow-moving objects and weak gravitational fields. Because it was among the new 19th-century discoveries that changed physics. Critical Thinking Can classical physics be used to accurately describe a satellite moving at a speed of 7500 m/s? Explain why or why not. No, because the satellite is moving at a speed much smaller than the speed of the light and is not in a strong gravitational field. No, because the satellite is moving at a speed much smaller than the speed of the light and is in a strong gravitational field. Yes, because the satellite is moving at a speed much smaller than the speed of the light and it is not in a strong gravitational field. Yes, because the satellite is moving at a speed much smaller than the speed of the light and is in a strong gravitational field.

The student uses a systematic approach to answer scientific laboratory and field investigative questions. The student is expected to: (A) know the definition of science and understand that it has limitations, as specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section; (B) know that scientific hypotheses are tentative and testable statements that must be capable of being supported or not supported by observational evidence. Hypotheses of durable explanatory power which have been tested over a wide variety of conditions are incorporated into theories; (C) know that scientific theories are based on natural and physical phenomena and are capable of being tested by multiple independent researchers. Unlike hypotheses, scientific theories are well-established and highly-reliable explanations, but may be subject to change as new areas of science and new technologies are developed; (D) distinguish between scientific hypotheses and scientific theories. Section Key Terms experiment hypothesis model observation principle scientific law scientific methods theory universal Teacher Support [OL]Pre-assessment for this section could involve students sharing or writing down an anecdote about when they used the methods of science. Then, students could label their thought processes in their anecdote with the appropriate scientific methods. The class could also discuss their definitions of theory and law, both outside and within the context of science. [OL]It should be noted and possibly mentioned that a scientist, as mentioned in this section, does not necessarily mean a trained scientist. It could be anyone using methods of science. Scientific Methods Scientists often plan and carry out investigations to answer questions about the universe around us. These investigations may lead to natural laws. Such laws are intrinsic to the universe, meaning that humans did not create them and cannot change them. We can only discover and understand them. Their discovery is a very human endeavor, with all the elements of mystery, imagination, struggle, triumph, and disappointment inherent in any creative effort. The cornerstone of discovering natural laws is observation. Science must describe the universe as it is, not as we imagine or wish it to be. We all are curious to some extent. We look around, make generalizations, and try to understand what we see. For example, we look up and wonder whether one type of cloud signals an oncoming storm. As we become serious about exploring nature, we become more organized and formal in collecting and analyzing data. We attempt greater precision, perform controlled experiments (if we can), and write down ideas about how data may be organized. We then formulate models, theories, and laws based on the data we have collected, and communicate those results with others. This, in a nutshell, describes the scientific method that scientists employ to decide scientific issues on the basis of evidence from observation and experiment.An investigation often begins with a scientist making an observation. The scientist observes a pattern or trend within the natural world. Observation may generate questions that the scientist wishes to answer. Next, the scientist may perform some research about the topic and devise a hypothesis. A hypothesis is a testable statement that describes how something in the natural world works. In essence, a hypothesis is an educated guess that explains something about an observation. Teacher Support [OL] An educated guess is used throughout this section in describing a hypothesis to combat the tendency to think of a theory as an educated guess. Scientists may test the hypothesis by performing an experiment. During an experiment, the scientist collects data that will help them learn about the phenomenon they are studying. Then the scientists analyze the results of the experiment (that is, the data), often using statistical, mathematical, and/or graphical methods. From the data analysis, they draw conclusions. They may conclude that their experiment either supports or rejects their hypothesis. If the hypothesis is supported, the scientist usually goes on to test another hypothesis related to the first. If their hypothesis is rejected, they will often then test a new and different hypothesis in their effort to learn more about whatever they are studying. Scientific processes can be applied to many situations. Let’s say that you try to turn on your car, but it will not start. You have just made an observation! You ask yourself, \"Why won’t my car start?\" You can now use scientific processes to answer this question. First, you generate a hypothesis such as, \"The car won’t start because it has no gasoline in the gas tank.\" To test this hypothesis, you put gasoline in the car and try to start it again. If the car starts, then your hypothesis is supported by the experiment. If the car does not start, then your hypothesis is rejected. You will then need to think up a new hypothesis to test such as, \"My car won’t start because the fuel pump is broken.\" Hopefully, your investigations lead you to discover why the car wont start and enable you to fix it. Modeling A model is a representation of something that is often too difficult (or impossible) to study directly. Models can take the form of physical models, equations, computer programs, or simulations—computer graphics/animations. Models are tools that are especially useful in modern physics because they let us visualize phenomena that we normally cannot observe with our senses, such as very small objects or objects that move at high speeds. For example, we can understand the structure of an atom using models, without seeing an atom with our own eyes. Although images of single atoms are now possible, these images are extremely difficult to achieve and are only possible due to the success of our models. The existence of these images is a consequence rather than a source of our understanding of atoms. Models are always approximate, so they are simpler to consider than the real situation; the more complete a model is, the more complicated it must be. Models put the intangible or the extremely complex into human terms that we can visualize, discuss, and hypothesize about. Scientific models are constructed based on the results of previous experiments. Even still, models often only describe a phenomenon partially or in a few limited situations. Some phenomena are so complex that they may be impossible to model them in their entirety, even using computers. An example is the electron cloud model of the atom in which electrons are moving around the atom’s center in distinct clouds (), that represent the likelihood of finding an electron in different places. This model helps us to visualize the structure of an atom. However, it does not show us exactly where an electron will be within its cloud at any one particular time. The electron cloud model of the atom predicts the geometry and shape of areas where different electrons may be found in an atom. However, it cannot indicate exactly where an electron will be at any one time. As mentioned previously, physicists use a variety of models including equations, physical models, computer simulations, etc. For example, three-dimensional models are often commonly used in chemistry and physics to model molecules. Properties other than appearance or location are usually modelled using mathematics, where functions are used to show how these properties relate to one another. Processes such as the formation of a star or the planets, can also be modelled using computer simulations. Once a simulation is correctly programmed based on actual experimental data, the simulation can allow us to view processes that happened in the past or happen too quickly or slowly for us to observe directly. In addition, scientists can also run virtual experiments using computer-based models. In a model of planet formation, for example, the scientist could alter the amount or type of rocks present in space and see how it affects planet formation. Scientists use models and experimental results to construct explanations of observations or design solutions to problems. For example, one way to make a car more fuel efficient is to reduce the friction or drag caused by air flowing around the moving car. This can be done by designing the body shape of the car to be more aerodynamic, such as by using rounded corners instead of sharp ones. Engineers can then construct physical models of the car body, place them in a wind tunnel, and examine the flow of air around the model. This can also be done mathematically in a computer simulation. The air flow pattern can be analyzed for regions smooth air flow and for eddies that indicate drag. The model of the car body may have to be altered slightly to produce the smoothest pattern of air flow (i.e., the least drag). The pattern with the least drag may be the solution to increasing fuel efficiency of the car. This solution might then be incorporated into the car design. Using Models and the Scientific Processes Be sure to secure loose items before opening the window or door. In this activity, you will learn about scientific models by making a model of how air flows through your classroom or a room in your house. One room with at least one window or door that can be opened Piece of single-ply tissue paper Work with a group of four, as directed by your teacher. Close all of the windows and doors in the room you are working in. Your teacher may assign you a specific window or door to study. Before opening any windows or doors, draw a to-scale diagram of your room. First, measure the length and width of your room using the tape measure. Then, transform the measurement using a scale that could fit on your paper, such as 5 centimeters = 1 meter. Your teacher will assign you a specific window or door to study air flow. On your diagram, add arrows showing your hypothesis (before opening any windows or doors) of how air will flow through the room when your assigned window or door is opened. Use pencil so that you can easily make changes to your diagram. On your diagram, mark four locations where you would like to test air flow in your room. To test for airflow, hold a strip of single ply tissue paper between the thumb and index finger. Note the direction that the paper moves when exposed to the airflow. Then, for each location, predict which way the paper will move if your air flow diagram is correct. Now, each member of your group will stand in one of the four selected areas. Each member will test the airflow Agree upon an approximate height at which everyone will hold their papers. When you teacher tells you to, open your assigned window and/or door. Each person should note the direction that their paper points immediately after the window or door was opened. Record your results on your diagram. Did the airflow test data support or refute the hypothetical model of air flow shown in your diagram? Why or why not? Correct your model based on your experimental evidence. With your group, discuss how accurate your model is. What limitations did it have? Write down the limitations that your group agreed upon. Teacher Support This Snap Lab! has students construct a model of how air flows in their classroom. Each group of four students will create a model of air flow in their classroom using a scale drawing of the room. Then, the groups will test the validity of their model by placing weathervanes that they have constructed around the room and opening a window or door. By observing the weather vanes, students will see how air actually flows through the room from a specific window or door. Students will then correct their model based on their experimental evidence. The following material list is given per group: One room with at least one window or door that can be opened (An optimal configuration would be one window or door per group.) Several pieces of construction paper (at least four per group) Strips of single ply tissue paper One tape measure (long enough to measure the dimensions of the room) Straws Scissors tape Group size can vary depending on the number of windows/doors available and the number of students in the class. The room dimensions could be provided by the teacher. Also, students may need a brief introduction in how to make a drawing to scale. This is another opportunity to discuss controlled experiments in terms of why the students should hold the strips of tissue paper at the same height and in the same way. One student could also serve as a control and stand far away from the window/door or in another area that will not receive air flow from the window/door. You will probably need to coordinate this when multiple windows or doors are used. Only one window or door should be opened at a time for best results. Between openings, allow a short period (5 minutes) when all windows and doors are closed, if possible. Answers to the Grasp Check will vary, but the air flow in the new window or door should be based on what the students observed in their experiment. Scientific Laws and Theories A scientific law is a description of a pattern in nature that is true in all circumstances that have been studied. That is, physical laws are meant to be universal, meaning that they apply throughout the known universe. Laws are often also concise, whereas theories are more complicated. A law can be expressed in the form of a single sentence or mathematical equation. For example, Newton’s second law of motion, which relates the motion of an object to the force applied (F), the mass of the object (m), and the object’s acceleration (a), is simply stated using the equation F=ma. Scientific ideas and explanations that are true in many, but not all situations in the universe are usually called principles. An example is Pascal’s principle, which explains properties of liquids, but not solids or gases. However, the distinction between laws and principles is sometimes not carefully made in science. A theory is an explanation for patterns in nature that is supported by much scientific evidence and verified multiple times by multiple researchers. While many people confuse theories with educated guesses or hypotheses, theories have withstood more rigorous testing and verification than hypotheses. Teacher Support [OL]Explain to students that in informal, everyday English the word theory can be used to describe an idea that is possibly true but that has not been proven to be true. This use of the word theory often leads people to think that scientific theories are nothing more than educated guesses. This is not just a misconception among students, but among the general public as well. As a closing idea about scientific processes, we want to point out that scientific laws and theories, even those that have been supported by experiments for centuries, can still be changed by new discoveries. This is especially true when new technologies emerge that allow us to observe things that were formerly unobservable. Imagine how viewing previously invisible objects with a microscope or viewing Earth for the first time from space may have instantly changed our scientific theories and laws! What discoveries still await us in the future? The constant retesting and perfecting of our scientific laws and theories allows our knowledge of nature to progress. For this reason, many scientists are reluctant to say that their studies prove anything. By saying support instead of prove, it keeps the door open for future discoveries, even if they won’t occur for centuries or even millennia. Teacher Support [OL]With regard to scientists avoiding using the word prove, the general public knows that science has proven certain things such as that the heart pumps blood and the Earth is round. However, scientists should shy away from using prove because it is impossible to test every single instance and every set of conditions in a system to absolutely prove anything. Using support or similar terminology leaves the door open for further discovery. Check Your Understanding Teacher Support Use the Check Your Understanding questions to assess students’ achievement of the section’s learning objectives. If students are struggling with a specific objective, the Check Your Understanding will help identify which objective and direct students to the relevant content. Section Summary Science seeks to discover and describe the underlying order and simplicity in nature. The processes of science include observation, hypothesis, experiment, and conclusion. Theories are scientific explanations that are supported by a large body experimental results. Scientific laws are concise descriptions of the universe that are universally true. Concept Items Critical Thinking Light travels as waves at an approximate speed of 300,000,000 m/s (186,000 mi/s). Designers of devices that use mirrors and lenses model the traveling light by straight lines, or light rays. Describe why it would be useful to model the light as rays of light instead of describing them accurately as electromagnetic waves. A model can be constructed in such a way that the speed of light decreases. Studying a model makes it easier to analyze the path that the light follows. Studying a model will help us to visualize why light travels at such great speed. Modeling cannot be used to study traveling light as our eyes cannot track the motion of light. A friend says that he doesnt trust scientific explanations because they are just theories, which are basically educated guesses. What could you say to convince him that scientific theories are different from the everyday use of the word theory? A theory is a scientific explanation that has been repeatedly tested and supported by many experiments. A theory is a hypothesis that has been tested and supported by some experiments. A theory is a set of educated guesses, but at least one of the guesses remain true in each experiment. A theory is a set of scientific explanations that has at least one experiment in support of it. Test Prep Multiple Choice A scientist wishes to study the motion of about 1,000 molecules of gas in a container by modeling them as tiny billiard balls bouncing randomly off one another. Which of the following is needed to calculate and store data on their detailed motion? a group of hypotheses that cannot be practically tested in real life a computer that can store and perform calculations on large data sets a large amount of experimental results on the molecules and their motion a collection of hypotheses that have not yet been tested regarding the molecules Test Prep Short Answer Explain the advantages and disadvantages of using a model to predict a life-or-death situation, such as whether or not an asteroid will strike Earth. The advantage of using a model is that it provides predictions quickly, but the disadvantage of using a model is that it could make erroneous predictions. The advantage of using a model is that it provides accurate predictions, but the disadvantage of using a model is that it takes a long time to make predictions. The advantage of using a model is that it provides predictions quickly without any error. There are no disadvantages of using a scientific model. The disadvantage of using models is that it takes longer time to make predictions and the predictions are inaccurate. There are no advantages to using a scientific model.

One could also poll the class for what they think accuracy, precision, and uncertainty refer to. For graphing, students could make a quick graph of some data and then edit their graph after reading to note ways they could improve the clarity of their graph. The Role of Units Physicists, like other scientists, make observations and ask basic questions. For example, how big is an object? How much mass does it have? How far did it travel? To answer these questions, they make measurements with various instruments (e.g., meter stick, balance, stopwatch, etc.). The measurements of physical quantities are expressed in terms of units, which are standardized values. For example, the length of a race, which is a physical quantity, can be expressed in meters (for sprinters) or kilometers (for long distance runners). Without standardized units, it would be extremely difficult for scientists to express and compare measured values in a meaningful way (). Distances given in unknown units are maddeningly useless.All physical quantities in the International System of Units (SI) are expressed in terms of combinations of seven fundamental physical units, which are units for: length, mass, time, electric current, temperature, amount of a substance, and luminous intensity. SI Units: Fundamental and Derived Units In any system of units, the units for some physical quantities must be defined through a measurement process. These are called the base quantities for that system and their units are the system’s base units. All other physical quantities can then be expressed as algebraic combinations of the base quantities. Each of these physical quantities is then known as a derived quantity and each unit is called a derived unit. The choice of base quantities is somewhat arbitrary, as long as they are independent of each other and all other quantities can be derived from them. Typically, the goal is to choose physical quantities that can be measured accurately to a high precision as the base quantities. The reason for this is simple. Since the derived units can be expressed as algebraic combinations of the base units, they can only be as accurate and precise as the base units from which they are derived. Teacher Support [OL]As a clarification, certain countries use the British system for a few of their measurements. For example, Britain still uses the pint to measure beer, miles to measure road distances, and pounds to measure body weight (although weight must be reported in kg in British medical records). The British people still use the British system extensively in their everyday lives, but the metric system is the official standard for the government. Likewise, many oil-producing countries measure oil in British gallons. Based on such considerations, the International Standards Organization recommends using seven base quantities, which form the International System of Quantities (ISQ). These are the base quantities used to define the SI base units. () lists these seven ISQ base quantities and the corresponding SI base units.SI Base Units Quantity Name Symbol Length Meter m Mass Kilogram kg Time Second s Electric current Ampere A Temperature Kelvin K Amount of substance Mole mol Luminous intensity Candela cd The Meter The SI unit for length is the meter (m). The definition of the meter has changed over time to become more accurate and precise. The meter was first defined in 1791 as 1/10,000,000 of the distance from the equator to the North Pole. This measurement was improved in 1889 by redefining the meter to be the distance between two engraved lines on a platinum-iridium bar. (The bar is now housed at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, near Paris). By 1960, some distances could be measured more precisely by comparing them to wavelengths of light. The meter was redefined as 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of orange light emitted by krypton atoms. In 1983, the meter was given its present definition as the distance light travels in a vacuum in 1/ 299,792,458 of a second (). The meter is defined to be the distance light travels in 1/299,792,458 of a second through a vacuum. Distance traveled is speed multiplied by time. The Kilogram The SI unit for mass is the kilogram (abbreviated kg); it was previously defined to be the mass of a platinum-iridium cylinder kept with the old meter standard at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures near Paris. Exact replicas of the previously defined kilogram are also kept at the United States’ National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, located in Gaithersburg, Maryland outside of Washington D.C., and at other locations around the world. The determination of all other masses could be ultimately traced to a comparison with the standard mass. Even though the platinum-iridium cylinder was resistant to corrosion, airborne contaminants were able to adhere to its surface, slightly changing its mass over time. In May 2019, the scientific community adopted a more stable definition of the kilogram. The kilogram is now defined in terms of the second, the meter, and Planck's constant, h (a quantum mechanical value that relates a photon's energy to its frequency). The Second The SI unit for time, the second (s) also has a long history. For many years it was defined as 1/86,400 of an average solar day. However, the average solar day is actually very gradually getting longer due to gradual slowing of Earth’s rotation. Accuracy in the fundamental units is essential, since all other measurements are derived from them. Therefore, a new standard was adopted to define the second in terms of a non-varying, or constant, physical phenomenon. One constant phenomenon is the very steady vibration of Cesium atoms, which can be observed and counted. This vibration forms the basis of the cesium atomic clock. In 1967, the second was redefined as the time required for 9,192,631,770 Cesium atom vibrations (). An atomic clock such as this one uses the vibrations of cesium atoms to keep time to a precision of one microsecond per year. The fundamental unit of time, the second, is based on such clocks. This image is looking down from the top of an atomic clock. (Steve Jurvetson/Flickr) Teacher Support [BL]An average solar day was used to originally define the second because the length of a solar day varies throughout the year due to Earth’s tilt of its axis as well as its elliptical orbit. The accumulation of these variations could result in a day length difference of up to 16 minutes during different seasons. Using an average solar day resolves these variations in day length. The Ampere Electric current is measured in the ampere (A), named after Andre Ampere. You have probably heard of amperes, or amps, when people discuss electrical currents or electrical devices. Understanding an ampere requires a basic understanding of electricity and magnetism, something that will be explored in depth in later chapters of this book. Basically, two parallel wires with an electric current running through them will produce an attractive force on each other. One ampere is defined as the amount of electric current that will produce an attractive force of 2.7 × 10–7 newton per meter of separation between the two wires (the newton is the derived unit of force). Teacher Support [BL]Some students may not know that a vacuum is a region of space that contains no air. Kelvins The SI unit of temperature is the kelvin (or kelvins, but not degrees kelvin). This scale is named after physicist William Thomson, Lord Kelvin, who was the first to call for an absolute temperature scale. The Kelvin scale is based on absolute zero. This is the point at which all thermal energy has been removed from all atoms or molecules in a system. This temperature, 0 K, is equal to −273.15 °C and −459.67 °F. Conveniently, the Kelvin scale actually changes in the same way as the Celsius scale. For example, the freezing point (0 °C) and boiling points of water (100 °C) are 100 degrees apart on the Celsius scale. These two temperatures are also 100 kelvins apart (freezing point = 273.15 K; boiling point = 373.15 K). Metric PrefixesPhysical objects or phenomena may vary widely. For example, the size of objects varies from something very small (like an atom) to something very large (like a star). Yet the standard metric unit of length is the meter. So, the metric system includes many prefixes that can be attached to a unit. Each prefix is based on factors of 10 (10, 100, 1,000, etc., as well as 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, etc.). gives the metric prefixes and symbols used to denote the different various factors of 10 in the metric system. Metric Prefixes for Powers of 10 and Their Symbols Prefix Symbol ValueSee Appendix A for a discussion of powers of 10.

The metric system is convenient because conversions between metric units can be done simply by moving the decimal place of a number. This is because the metric prefixes are sequential powers of 10. There are 100 centimeters in a meter, 1000 meters in a kilometer, and so on. In nonmetric systems, such as U.S. customary units, the relationships are less simple—there are 12 inches in a foot, 5,280 feet in a mile, 4 quarts in a gallon, and so on. Another advantage of the metric system is that the same unit can be used over extremely large ranges of values simply by switching to the most-appropriate metric prefix. For example, distances in meters are suitable for building construction, but kilometers are used to describe road construction. Therefore, with the metric system, there is no need to invent new units when measuring very small or very large objects—you just have to move the decimal point (and use the appropriate prefix). Known Ranges of Length, Mass, and Time lists known lengths, masses, and time measurements. You can see that scientists use a range of measurement units. This wide range demonstrates the vastness and complexity of the universe, as well as the breadth of phenomena physicists study. As you examine this table, note how the metric system allows us to discuss and compare an enormous range of phenomena, using one system of measurement ( and ).Approximate Values of Length, Mass, and Time Length (m) Phenomenon Measured Mass (Kg) Phenomenon Measured[1] Time (s) Phenomenon Measured[1] 10–18 Present experimental limit to smallest observable detail 10–30 Mass of an electron (9.11 × 10–31 kg) 10–23 Time for light to cross a proton 10–15 Diameter of a proton 10–27 Mass of a hydrogen atom (1.67 × 10–27 kg) 10–22 Mean life of an extremely unstable nucleus 10–14 Diameter of a uranium nucleus 10–15 Mass of a bacterium 10–15 Time for one oscillation of a visible light 10–10 Diameter of a hydrogen atom 10–5 Mass of a mosquito 10–13 Time for one vibration of an atom in a solid 10–8 Thickness of membranes in cell of living organism 10–2 Mass of a hummingbird 10–8 Time for one oscillation of an FM radio wave 10–6 Wavelength of visible light 1 Mass of a liter of water (about a quart) 10–3 Duration of a nerve impulse 10–3 Size of a grain of sand 102 Mass of a person 1 Time for one heartbeat 1 Height of a 4-year-old child 103 Mass of a car 105 One day (8.64 × 104 s) 102 Length of a football field 108 Mass of a large ship 107 One year (3.16 × 107 s) 104 Greatest ocean depth 1012 Mass of a large iceberg 109 About half the life expectancy of a human 107 Diameter of Earth 1015 Mass of the nucleus of a comet 1011 Recorded history 1011 Distance from Earth to the sun 1023 Mass of the moon (7.35 × 1022 kg) 1017 Age of Earth 1016 Distance traveled by light in 1 year (a light year) 1025 Mass of Earth (5.97 × 1024 kg) 1018 Age of the universe 1021 Diameter of the Milky Way Galaxy 1030 Mass of the Sun (1.99 × 1030 kg) 1022 Distance from Earth to the nearest large galaxy (Andromeda) 1042 Mass of the Milky Way galaxy (current upper limit) 1026 Distance from Earth to the edges of the known universe 1053 Mass of the known universe (current upper limit) [1] More precise values are in parentheses.

(NASA/CXC/UVic./A. Mahdavi et al. Optical/lensing: CFHT/UVic./H. Hoekstra et al.) Using Scientific Notation with Physical Measurements Scientific notation is a way of writing numbers that are too large or small to be conveniently written as a decimal. For example, consider the number 840,000,000,000,000. It’s a rather large number to write out. The scientific notation for this number is 8.40 × 1014. Scientific notation follows this general format x × 10 y . In this format x is the value of the measurement with all placeholder zeros removed. In the example above, x is 8.4. The x is multiplied by a factor, 10y, which indicates the number of placeholder zeros in the measurement. Placeholder zeros are those at the end of a number that is 10 or greater, and at the beginning of a decimal number that is less than 1. In the example above, the factor is 1014. This tells you that you should move the decimal point 14 positions to the right, filling in placeholder zeros as you go. In this case, moving the decimal point 14 places creates only 13 placeholder zeros, indicating that the actual measurement value is 840,000,000,000,000. Numbers that are fractions can be indicated by scientific notation as well. Consider the number 0.0000045. Its scientific notation is 4.5 × 10–6. Its scientific notation has the same format x × 10 y . Here, x is 4.5. However, the value of y in the 10y factor is negative, which indicates that the measurement is a fraction of 1. Therefore, we move the decimal place to the left, for a negative y. In our example of 4.5 × 10–6, the decimal point would be moved to the left six times to yield the original number, which would be 0.0000045.The term order of magnitude refers to the power of 10 when numbers are expressed in scientific notation. Quantities that have the same power of 10 when expressed in scientific notation, or come close to it, are said to be of the same order of magnitude. For example, the number 800 can be written as 8 × 102, and the number 450 can be written as 4.5 × 102. Both numbers have the same value for y. Therefore, 800 and 450 are of the same order of magnitude. Similarly, 101 and 99 would be regarded as the same order of magnitude, 102. Order of magnitude can be thought of as a ballpark estimate for the scale of a value. The diameter of an atom is on the order of 10−9 m, while the diameter of the sun is on the order of 109 m. These two values are 18 orders of magnitude apart.Scientists make frequent use of scientific notation because of the vast range of physical measurements possible in the universe, such as the distance from Earth to the moon (), or to the nearest star. The distance from Earth to the moon may seem immense, but it is just a tiny fraction of the distance from Earth to our closest neighboring star. (NASA) Unit Conversion and Dimensional Analysis It is often necessary to convert from one type of unit to another. For example, if you are reading a European cookbook in the United States, some quantities may be expressed in liters and you need to convert them to cups. A Canadian tourist driving through the United States might want to convert miles to kilometers, to have a sense of how far away his next destination is. A doctor in the United States might convert a patient’s weight in pounds to kilograms.Let’s consider a simple example of how to convert units within the metric system. How can we convert 1 hour to seconds?First, we need to determine a conversion factor. A conversion factor is a ratio expressing how many of one unit are equal to another unit. A conversion factor is simply a fraction which equals 1. You can multiply any number by 1 and get the same value. When you multiply a number by a conversion factor, you are simply multiplying it by one. For example, the following are conversion factors: (1 foot)/(12 inches) = 1 to convert inches to feet, (1 meter)/(100 centimeters) = 1 to convert centimeters to meters, (1 minute)/(60 seconds) = 1 to convert seconds to minutes.Now we can set up our unit conversion. We will write the units that we have and then multiply them by the conversion factor (1 km/1,000m) = 1, so we are simply multiplying 80m by 1: 1 h × 60 min 1 h × 60 s 1 min =3600 s = 3 .6 × 10 3 s When there is a unit in the original number, and a unit in the denominator (bottom) of the conversion factor, the units cancel. In this case, hours and minutes cancel and the value in seconds remains. You can use this method to convert between any types of unit, including between the U.S. customary system and metric system. Notice also that, although you can multiply and divide units algebraically, you cannot add or subtract different units. An expression like 10 km + 5 kg makes no sense. Even adding two lengths in different units, such as 10 km + 20 m does not make sense. You express both lengths in the same unit. See Reference Tables for a more complete list of conversion factors. Unit Conversions: A Short Drive Home Suppose that you drive the 10.0 km from your university to home in 20.0 min. Calculate your average speed (a) in kilometers per hour (km/h) and (b) in meters per second (m/s). (Note—Average speed is distance traveled divided by time of travel.) Strategy First we calculate the average speed using the given units. Then we can get the average speed into the desired units by picking the correct conversion factor and multiplying by it. The correct conversion factor is the one that cancels the unwanted unit and leaves the desired unit in its place. Solution for (a) Calculate average speed. Average speed is distance traveled divided by time of travel. (Take this definition as a given for now—average speed and other motion concepts will be covered in a later module.) In equation form, average speed = distance time . Substitute the given values for distance and time. average speed = 10.0 km 20.0 min =0.500 km min Convert km/min to km/h: multiply by the conversion factor that will cancel minutes and leave hours. That conversion factor is 60min/1h . Thus, average speed = 0.500 km min × 60 min 1 h =30.0 km h . Discussion for (a) To check your answer, consider the following: Be sure that you have properly cancelled the units in the unit conversion. If you have written the unit conversion factor upside down, the units will not cancel properly in the equation. If you accidentally get the ratio upside down, then the units will not cancel; rather, they will give you the wrong units as follows km min × 1 hr 60 min = 1 60 km·h min 2 , which are obviously not the desired units of km/h. Check that the units of the final answer are the desired units. The problem asked us to solve for average speed in units of km/h and we have indeed obtained these units. Check the significant figures. Because each of the values given in the problem has three significant figures, the answer should also have three significant figures. The answer 30.0 km/h does indeed have three significant figures, so this is appropriate. Note that the significant figures in the conversion factor are not relevant because an hour is defined to be 60 min, so the precision of the conversion factor is perfect. Next, check whether the answer is reasonable. Let us consider some information from the problem—if you travel 10 km in a third of an hour (20 min), you would travel three times that far in an hour. The answer does seem reasonable. Solution (b) There are several ways to convert the average speed into meters per second. Start with the answer to (a) and convert km/h to m/s. Two conversion factors are needed—one to convert hours to seconds, and another to convert kilometers to meters. Multiplying by these yields Averagespeed=30.0 km h × 1 h 3,600 s × 1,000 m 1 km Averagespeed=8.33 m s Discussion for (b) If we had started with 0.500 km/min, we would have needed different conversion factors, but the answer would have been the same: 8.33 m/s. You may have noted that the answers in the worked example just covered were given to three digits. Why? When do you need to be concerned about the number of digits in something you calculate? Why not write down all the digits your calculator produces? Using Physics to Evaluate Promotional Materials A commemorative coin that is 2″ in diameter is advertised to be plated with 15 mg of gold. If the density of gold is 19.3 g/cc, and the amount of gold around the edge of the coin can be ignored, what is the thickness of the gold on the top and bottom faces of the coin? Strategy To solve this problem, the volume of the gold needs to be determined using the gold’s mass and density. Half of that volume is distributed on each face of the coin, and, for each face, the gold can be represented as a cylinder that is 2″ in diameter with a height equal to the thickness. Use the volume formula for a cylinder to determine the thickness. Solution The mass of the gold is given by the formula m=ρV=15× 10 −3 g, where ρ=19.3g/cc and V is the volume. Solving for the volume gives V= m ρ = 15× 10 −3 g 19.3g/cc ≅7.8× 10 −4 cc. If t is the thickness, the volume corresponding to half the gold is 1 2 ( 7.8× 10 −4 )=π r 2 t=π ( 2.54 ) 2 t, where the 1″ radius has been converted to cm. Solving for the thickness gives t= ( 3.9× 10 −4 ) π ( 2.54 ) 2 ≅1.9× 10 −5 cm=0.00019 mm. Discussion The amount of gold used is stated to be 15 mg, which is equivalent to a thickness of about 0.00019 mm. The mass figure may make the amount of gold sound larger, both because the number is much bigger (15 versus 0.00019), and because people may have a more intuitive feel for how much a millimeter is than for how much a milligram is. A simple analysis of this sort can clarify the significance of claims made by advertisers. Teacher Support Ask students to find other promotional materials that make claims that can be analyzed using physics principles. Compile any items that come in for later use at appropriate points in the course. For example, after covering power consumption in electric circuits, compare the performance of electric fireplaces advertised as revolutionary to the performance of standard space heaters. Accuracy, Precision and Significant Figures Science is based on experimentation that requires good measurements. The validity of a measurement can be described in terms of its accuracy and its precision (see and ). Accuracy is how close a measurement is to the correct value for that measurement. For example, let us say that you are measuring the length of standard piece of printer paper. The packaging in which you purchased the paper states that it is 11 inches long, and suppose this stated value is correct. You measure the length of the paper three times and obtain the following measurements: 11.1 inches, 11.2 inches, and 10.9 inches. These measurements are quite accurate because they are very close to the correct value of 11.0 inches. In contrast, if you had obtained a measurement of 12 inches, your measurement would not be very accurate. This is why measuring instruments are calibrated based on a known measurement. If the instrument consistently returns the correct value of the known measurement, it is safe for use in finding unknown values. A double-pan mechanical balance is used to compare different masses. Usually an object with unknown mass is placed in one pan and objects of known mass are placed in the other pan. When the bar that connects the two pans is horizontal, then the masses in both pans are equal. The known masses are typically metal cylinders of standard mass such as 1 gram, 10 grams, and 100 grams. (Serge Melki) Whereas a mechanical balance may only read the mass of an object to the nearest tenth of a gram, some digital scales can measure the mass of an object up to the nearest thousandth of a gram. As in other measuring devices, the precision of a scale is limited to the last measured figures. This is the hundredths place in the scale pictured here. (Splarka, Wikimedia Commons)Precision states how well repeated measurements of something generate the same or similar results. Therefore, the precision of measurements refers to how close together the measurements are when you measure the same thing several times. One way to analyze the precision of measurements would be to determine the range, or difference between the lowest and the highest measured values. In the case of the printer paper measurements, the lowest value was 10.9 inches and the highest value was 11.2 inches. Thus, the measured values deviated from each other by, at most, 0.3 inches. These measurements were reasonably precise because they varied by only a fraction of an inch. However, if the measured values had been 10.9 inches, 11.1 inches, and 11.9 inches, then the measurements would not be very precise because there is a lot of variation from one measurement to another. The measurements in the paper example are both accurate and precise, but in some cases, measurements are accurate but not precise, or they are precise but not accurate. Let us consider a GPS system that is attempting to locate the position of a restaurant in a city. Think of the restaurant location as existing at the center of a bull’s-eye target. Then think of each GPS attempt to locate the restaurant as a black dot on the bull’s eye. In , you can see that the GPS measurements are spread far apart from each other, but they are all relatively close to the actual location of the restaurant at the center of the target. This indicates a low precision, high accuracy measuring system. However, in , the GPS measurements are concentrated quite closely to one another, but they are far away from the target location. This indicates a high precision, low accuracy measuring system. Finally, in , the GPS is both precise and accurate, allowing the restaurant to be located. A GPS system attempts to locate a restaurant at the center of the bull’s-eye. The black dots represent each attempt to pinpoint the location of the restaurant. The dots are spread out quite far apart from one another, indicating low precision, but they are each rather close to the actual location of the restaurant, indicating high accuracy. (Dark Evil) In this figure, the dots are concentrated close to one another, indicating high precision, but they are rather far away from the actual location of the restaurant, indicating low accuracy. (Dark Evil) In this figure, the dots are concentrated close to one another, indicating high precision, and they are very close to the actual location of the restaurant, indicating high accuracy. (Dark Evil) Uncertainty The accuracy and precision of a measuring system determine the uncertainty of its measurements. Uncertainty is a way to describe your confidence in your measured value, or the range of values that would be consistent with the data. If your measurements are not very accurate or precise, then the uncertainty of your values will be very high. In more general terms, uncertainty can be thought of as a disclaimer for your measured values. For example, if someone asked you to provide the mileage on your car, you might say that it is 45,000 miles, plus or minus 500 miles. The plus or minus amount is the uncertainty in your value. That is, you are indicating that the actual mileage of your car might be as low as 44,500 miles or as high as 45,500 miles, or anywhere in between. All measurements contain some amount of uncertainty. In our example of measuring the length of the paper, we might say that the length of the paper is 11 inches plus or minus 0.2 inches or 11.0 ± 0.2 inches. The uncertainty in a measurement, A, is often denoted as δA (\"delta A\"). The actual value of the object may not be within the range given by the measurement and its uncertainty. In our paper length example above, a new set of measurements might produce a length of 14.0 ± 0.2 inches, with the uncertainty based on the accuracy or our reading or repeated measurements. We would also, however, conclude that either one of our measurement sets is incorrect due to an offset in the measurement process in that set, or our measurement correctly identifies that we are measuring different papers. In the former case, the discrepancy between the measured value and the actual value is called a systematic error. The factors contributing to uncertainty in a measurement include the following: Limitations of the measuring device The skill of the person making the measurement Irregularities in the object being measured Any other factors that affect the outcome (highly dependent on the situation) In the printer paper example uncertainty could be caused by: the fact that the smallest division on the ruler is 0.1 inches, the person using the ruler has bad eyesight, or uncertainty caused by the paper cutting machine (e.g., one side of the paper is slightly longer than the other.) It is good practice to carefully consider all possible sources of uncertainty in a measurement and reduce or eliminate them. Percent Uncertainty One method of expressing uncertainty is as a percent of the measured value. If a measurement, A, is expressed with uncertainty, δA, the percent uncertainty is % uncertainty = δA A × 100%. Calculating Percent Uncertainty: A Bag of Apples A grocery store sells 5-lb bags of apples. You purchase four bags over the course of a month and weigh the apples each time. You obtain the following measurements: Week 1 weight: 4.8lb Week 2 weight: 5.3lb Week 3 weight: 4.9lb Week 4 weight: 5.4lb You determine that the expected weight of a 5 lb bag has an uncertainty of ±0.4 lb. What is the percent uncertainty of the bag’s weight?Strategy First, observe that the expected value of the bag’s weight, A, is 5 lb. The uncertainty in this value, δA, is 0.4 lb. We can use the following equation to determine the percent uncertainty of the weight % uncertainty = δA A × 100%. Solution Plug the known values into the equation % uncertainty = 0.4 lb 5 lb ×100%=8%. Discussion We can conclude that the weight of the apple bag is 5 lb ± 8 percent. Consider how this percent uncertainty would change if the bag of apples were half as heavy, but the uncertainty in the weight remained the same. Hint for future calculations: when calculating percent uncertainty, always remember that you must multiply the fraction by 100 percent. If you do not do this, you will have a decimal quantity, not a percent value. Uncertainty in Calculations There is an uncertainty in anything calculated from measured quantities. For example, the area of a floor calculated from measurements of its length and width has an uncertainty because the both the length and width have uncertainties. How big is the uncertainty in something you calculate by multiplication or division? If the measurements in the calculation have small uncertainties (a few percent or less), then the method of adding percents can be used. This method says that the percent uncertainty in a quantity calculated by multiplication or division is the sum of the percent uncertainties in the items used to make the calculation. For example, if a floor has a length of 4.00 m and a width of 3.00 m, with uncertainties of 2 percent and 1 percent, respectively, then the area of the floor is 12.0 m2 and has an uncertainty of 3 percent (expressed as an area this is 0.36 m2, which we round to 0.4 m2 since the area of the floor is given to a tenth of a square meter). For more information on the accuracy, precision, and uncertainty of measurements based upon the units of measurement, visit this website. Precision of Measuring Tools and Significant Figures An important factor in the accuracy and precision of measurements is the precision of the measuring tool. In general, a precise measuring tool is one that can measure values in very small increments. For example, consider measuring the thickness of a coin. A standard ruler can measure thickness to the nearest millimeter, while a micrometer can measure the thickness to the nearest 0.005 millimeter. The micrometer is a more precise measuring tool because it can measure extremely small differences in thickness. The more precise the measuring tool, the more precise and accurate the measurements can be. When we express measured values, we can only list as many digits as we initially measured with our measuring tool (such as the rulers shown in ). For example, if you use a standard ruler to measure the length of a stick, you may measure it with a decimeter ruler as 3.6 cm. You could not express this value as 3.65 cm because your measuring tool was not precise enough to measure a hundredth of a centimeter. It should be noted that the last digit in a measured value has been estimated in some way by the person performing the measurement. For example, the person measuring the length of a stick with a ruler notices that the stick length seems to be somewhere in between 36 mm and 37 mm. He or she must estimate the value of the last digit. The rule is that the last digit written down in a measurement is the first digit with some uncertainty. For example, the last measured value 36.5 mm has three digits, or three significant figures. The number of significant figures in a measurement indicates the precision of the measuring tool. The more precise a measuring tool is, the greater the number of significant figures it can report. Three metric rulers are shown. The first ruler is in decimeters and can measure point three decimeters. The second ruler is in centimeters long and can measure three point six centimeters. The last ruler is in millimeters and can measure thirty-six point five millimeters. Zeros Special consideration is given to zeros when counting significant figures. For example, the zeros in 0.053 are not significant because they are only placeholders that locate the decimal point. There are two significant figures in 0.053—the 5 and the 3. However, if the zero occurs between other significant figures, the zeros are significant. For example, both zeros in 10.053 are significant, as these zeros were actually measured. Therefore, the 10.053 placeholder has five significant figures. The zeros in 1300 may or may not be significant, depending on the style of writing numbers. They could mean the number is known to the last zero, or the zeros could be placeholders. So 1300 could have two, three, or four significant figures. To avoid this ambiguity, write 1300 in scientific notation as 1.3 × 103. Only significant figures are given in the x factor for a number in scientific notation (in the form x×10y ). Therefore, we know that 1 and 3 are the only significant digits in this number. In summary, zeros are significant except when they serve only as placeholders. provides examples of the number of significant figures in various numbers. Number Significant Figures Rationale 1.657 4 There are no zeros and all non-zero numbers are always significant. 0.4578 4 The first zero is only a placeholder for the decimal point. 0.000458 3 The first four zeros are placeholders needed to report the data to the ten-thoudsandths place. 2000.56 6 The three zeros are significant here because they occur between other significant figures. 45,600 3 With no underlines or scientific notation, we assume that the last two zeros are placeholders and are not significant. 15895000 7 The two underlined zeros are significant, while the last zero is not, as it is not underlined. 5.457 × 1013 4 In scientific notation, all numbers reported in front of the multiplication sign are significant 6.520 × 10–23 4 In scientific notation, all numbers reported in front of the multiplication sign are significant, including zeros. Significant Figures in Calculations When combining measurements with different degrees of accuracy and precision, the number of significant digits in the final answer can be no greater than the number of significant digits in the least precise measured value. There are two different rules, one for multiplication and division and another rule for addition and subtraction, as discussed below. For multiplication and division: The answer should have the same number of significant figures as the starting value with the fewest significant figures. For example, the area of a circle can be calculated from its radius using A=π r 2 . Let us see how many significant figures the area will have if the radius has only two significant figures, for example, r = 2.0 m. Then, using a calculator that keeps eight significant figures, you would get A= π r 2 = ( 3.1415927... ) × ( 2.0 m ) 2 = 12.5663708 m 2 . But because the radius has only two significant figures, the area calculated is meaningful only to two significant figures or A= 13 m 2 even though the value of π is meaningful to at least eight digits. For addition and subtraction: The answer should have the same number places (e.g. tens place, ones place, tenths place, etc.) as the least-precise starting value. Suppose that you buy 7.56 kg of potatoes in a grocery store as measured with a scale having a precision of 0.01 kg. Then you drop off 6.052 kg of potatoes at your laboratory as measured by a scale with a precision of 0.001 kg. Finally, you go home and add 13.7 kg of potatoes as measured by a bathroom scale with a precision of 0.1 kg. How many kilograms of potatoes do you now have, and how many significant figures are appropriate in the answer? The mass is found by simple addition and subtraction: 7.56 kg −6.052 kg +13.7 kg _ 15.208 kg The least precise measurement is 13.7 kg. This measurement is expressed to the 0.1 decimal place, so our final answer must also be expressed to the 0.1 decimal place. Thus, the answer should be rounded to the tenths place, giving 15.2 kg. The same is true for non-decimal numbers. For example, 6527.23+2=6529.23=6529. We cannot report the decimal places in the answer because 2 has no decimal places that would be significant. Therefore, we can only report to the ones place. It is a good idea to keep extra significant figures while calculating, and to round off to the correct number of significant figures only in the final answers. The reason is that small errors from rounding while calculating can sometimes produce significant errors in the final answer. As an example, try calculating 5,098−( 5.000 )×( 1,010 ) to obtain a final answer to only two significant figures. Keeping all significant during the calculation gives 48. Rounding to two significant figures in the middle of the calculation changes it to 5,100 – (5.000) × (1,000) = 100, which is way off. You would similarly avoid rounding in the middle of the calculation in counting and in doing accounting, where many small numbers need to be added and subtracted accurately to give possibly much larger final numbers. Teacher Support Remind students that they will be expected to report the proper number of significant figures on assignment and test problems. Significant Figures in this Text In this textbook, most numbers are assumed to have three significant figures. Furthermore, consistent numbers of significant figures are used in all worked examples. You will note that an answer given to three digits is based on input good to at least three digits. If the input has fewer significant figures, the answer will also have fewer significant figures. Care is also taken that the number of significant figures is reasonable for the situation posed. In some topics, such as optics, more than three significant figures will be used. Finally, if a number is exact, such as the 2 in the formula, c=2πr , it does not affect the number of significant figures in a calculation. Approximating Vast Numbers: a Trillion Dollars The U.S. federal deficit in the 2008 fiscal year was a little greater than $10 trillion. Most of us do not have any concept of how much even one trillion actually is. Suppose that you were given a trillion dollars in $100 bills. If you made 100-bill stacks, like that shown in , and used them to evenly cover a football field (between the end zones), make an approximation of how high the money pile would become. (We will use feet/inches rather than meters here because football fields are measured in yards.) One of your friends says 3 in., while another says 10 ft. What do you think? A bank stack contains one hundred $100 bills, and is worth $10,000. How many bank stacks make up a trillion dollars? (Andrew Magill) Strategy When you imagine the situation, you probably envision thousands of small stacks of 100 wrapped $100 bills, such as you might see in movies or at a bank. Since this is an easy-to-approximate quantity, let us start there. We can find the volume of a stack of 100 bills, find out how many stacks make up one trillion dollars, and then set this volume equal to the area of the football field multiplied by the unknown height. Solution Calculate the volume of a stack of 100 bills. The dimensions of a single bill are approximately 3 in. by 6 in. A stack of 100 of these is about 0.5 in. thick. So the total volume of a stack of 100 bills is volume of stack=length×width×height, volume of stack=6 in.×3 in.×0.5 in., volume of stack=9 in . 3 . Calculate the number of stacks. Note that a trillion dollars is equal to $1× 10 12 , and a stack of one-hundred $100 bills is equal to $10,000, or $1× 10 4 . The number of stacks you will have is $1 × 10 12 (a trillion dollars) / $1 × 10 4 per stack = 1 × 10 8 stacks. Calculate the area of a football field in square inches. The area of a football field is 100 yd× 50yd , which gives 5,000 yd 2 . Because we are working in inches, we need to convert square yards to square inches Area = 5,000 yd 2 × 3 ft 1yd × 3 ft 1yd × 12 in. 1 foot × 12 in. 1 foot = 6,480,000 in . 2 , Area≈ 6 × 10 6 in . 2 . This conversion gives us 6 × 10 6 in . 2 for the area of the field. (Note that we are using only one significant figure in these calculations.) Calculate the total volume of the bills. The volume of all the $100-bill stacks is 9 in . 3 / stack × 10 8 stacks = 9 × 10 8 in . 3 Calculate the height. To determine the height of the bills, use the following equation volume of bills = area of field × height of money Height of money = volume of bills area of field Height of money = 9 × 10 8 in . 3 6 × 10 6 in . 2 = 1.5 × 10 2 in. Since the area is actually a little larger than 6 × 102, the height is a little less than 150, so round down to 100 inches rather than up to 200 inches. Height of money = 1×10 2 in.=100 in. The height of the money will be about 100 in. high. Converting this value to feet gives 100 in.× 1ft 12 in. =8.33 ft≈8 ft. Discussion The final approximate value is much higher than the early estimate of 3 in., but the other early estimate of 10 ft (120 in.) was roughly correct. How did the approximation measure up to your first guess? What can this exercise tell you in terms of rough guesstimates versus carefully calculated approximations? In the example above, the final approximate value is much higher than the first friend’s early estimate of 3 in. However, the other friend’s early estimate of 10 ft. (120 in.) was roughly correct. How did the approximation measure up to your first guess? What can this exercise suggest about the value of rough guesstimates versus carefully calculated approximations? Teacher Support In , point out to students the importance of precision in their measurements. Greater precision allows measurements to be less uncertain, and therefore, a close approximation rather than a guesstimate. Graphing in Physics Most results in science are presented in scientific journal articles using graphs. Graphs present data in a way that is easy to visualize for humans in general, especially someone unfamiliar with what is being studied. They are also useful for presenting large amounts of data or data with complicated trends in an easily-readable way. One commonly-used graph in physics and other sciences is the line graph, probably because it is the best graph for showing how one quantity changes in response to the other. Let’s build a line graph based on the data in , which shows the measured distance that a train travels from its station versus time. Our two variables, or things that change along the graph, are time in minutes, and distance from the station, in kilometers. Remember that measured data may not have perfect accuracy. Time (min) Distance from Station (km) 0 0 10 24 20 36 30 60 40 84 50 97 60 116 70 140 Draw the two axes. The horizontal axis, or x-axis, shows the independent variable, which is the variable that is controlled or manipulated. The vertical axis, or y-axis, shows the dependent variable, the non-manipulated variable that changes with (or is dependent on) the value of the independent variable. In the data above, time is the independent variable and should be plotted on the x-axis. Distance from the station is the dependent variable and should be plotted on the y-axis. Label each axes on the graph with the name of each variable, followed by the symbol for its units in parentheses. Be sure to leave room so that you can number each axis. In this example, use Time (min) as the label for the x-axis. Next, you must determine the best scale to use for numbering each axis. Because the time values on the x-axis are taken every 10 minutes, we could easily number the x-axis from 0 to 70 minutes with a tick mark every 10 minutes. Likewise, the y-axis scale should start low enough and continue high enough to include all of the distance from station values. A scale from 0 km to 160 km should suffice, perhaps with a tick mark every 10 km. In general, you want to pick a scale for both axes that 1) shows all of your data, and 2) makes it easy to identify trends in your data. If you make your scale too large, it will be harder to see how your data change. Likewise, the smaller and more fine you make your scale, the more space you will need to make the graph. The number of significant figures in the axis values should be coarser than the number of significant figures in the measurements. Now that your axes are ready, you can begin plotting your data. For the first data point, count along the x-axis until you find the 10 min tick mark. Then, count up from that point to the 10 km tick mark on the y-axis, and approximate where 22 km is along the y-axis. Place a dot at this location. Repeat for the other six data points (). The graph of the train’s distance from the station versus time from the exercise above. Add a title to the top of the graph to state what the graph is describing, such as the y-axis parameter vs. the x-axis parameter. In the graph shown here, the title is train motion. It could also be titled distance of the train from the station vs. time. Finally, with data points now on the graph, you should draw a trend line (). The trend line represents the dependence you think the graph represents, so that the person who looks at your graph can see how close it is to the real data. In the present case, since the data points look like they ought to fall on a straight line, you would draw a straight line as the trend line. Draw it to come closest to all the points. Real data may have some inaccuracies, and the plotted points may not all fall on the trend line. In some cases, none of the data points fall exactly on the trend line. The completed graph with the trend line included. Teacher Support [OL]The importance of bar graphs should also be mentioned as a useful way to show data relations when one variable is not continuous, such as in a frequency histogram, which compares how many data points fall into discrete categories. [OL]If students have difficulty understanding the difference between dependent and independent variables in the train example, explain that time is independent because it will continue to move forward at the same rate whether the train leaves the station or not. Analyzing a Graph Using Its Equation One way to get a quick snapshot of a dataset is to look at the equation of its trend line. If the graph produces a straight line, the equation of the trend line takes the form y=mx+b. The b in the equation is the y-intercept while the m in the equation is the slope. The y-intercept tells you at what y value the line intersects the y-axis. In the case of the graph above, the y-intercept occurs at 0, at the very beginning of the graph. The y-intercept, therefore, lets you know immediately where on the y-axis the plot line begins. The m in the equation is the slope. This value describes how much the line on the graph moves up or down on the y-axis along the line’s length. The slope is found using the following equation m= Y 2 − Y 1 X 2 − X 1 . In order to solve this equation, you need to pick two points on the line (preferably far apart on the line so the slope you calculate describes the line accurately). The quantities Y2 and Y1 represent the y-values from the two points on the line (not data points) that you picked, while X2 and X1 represent the two x-values of the those points. What can the slope value tell you about the graph? The slope of a perfectly horizontal line will equal zero, while the slope of a perfectly vertical line will be undefined because you cannot divide by zero. A positive slope indicates that the line moves up the y-axis as the x-value increases while a negative slope means that the line moves down the y-axis. The more negative or positive the slope is, the steeper the line moves up or down, respectively. The slope of our graph in is calculated below based on the two endpoints of the line m = Y 2 − Y 1 X 2 − X 1 m = (80 km) – (20 km) (40 min) – (10 min) m = 60 km 30 min m = 2.0 km/min. Equation of line: y=( 2.0 km/min )x+0 Because the x axis is time in minutes, we would actually be more likely to use the time t as the independent (x-axis) variable and write the equation as y=( 2.0 km/min )t+0. The formula y=mx+b only applies to linear relationships, or ones that produce a straight line. Another common type of line in physics is the quadratic relationship, which occurs when one of the variables is squared. One quadratic relationship in physics is the relation between the speed of an object its centripetal acceleration, which is used to determine the force needed to keep an object moving in a circle. Another common relationship in physics is the inverse relationship, in which one variable decreases whenever the other variable increases. An example in physics is Coulomb’s law. As the distance between two charged objects increases, the electrical force between the two charged objects decreases. Inverse proportionality, such the relation between x and y in the equation y=k/x, for some number k, is one particular kind of inverse relationship. A third commonly-seen relationship is the exponential relationship, in which a change in the independent variable produces a proportional change in the dependent variable. As the value of the dependent variable gets larger, its rate of growth also increases. For example, bacteria often reproduce at an exponential rate when grown under ideal conditions. As each generation passes, there are more and more bacteria to reproduce. As a result, the growth rate of the bacterial population increases every generation (). Examples of (a) linear, (b) quadratic, (c) inverse, and (d) exponential relationship graphs. Using Logarithmic Scales in GraphingSometimes a variable can have a very large range of values. This presents a problem when you’re trying to figure out the best scale to use for your graph’s axes. One option is to use a logarithmic (log) scale. In a logarithmic scale, the value each mark labels is the previous mark’s value multiplied by some constant. For a log base 10 scale, each mark labels a value that is 10 times the value of the mark before it. Therefore, a base 10 logarithmic scale would be numbered: 0, 10, 100, 1,000, etc. You can see how the logarithmic scale covers a much larger range of values than the corresponding linear scale, in which the marks would label the values 0, 10, 20, 30, and so on. If you use a logarithmic scale on one axis of the graph and a linear scale on the other axis, you are using a semi-log plot. The Richter scale, which measures the strength of earthquakes, uses a semi-log plot. The degree of ground movement is plotted on a logarithmic scale against the assigned intensity level of the earthquake, which ranges linearly from 1-10 ( (a)). If a graph has both axes in a logarithmic scale, then it is referred to as a log-log plot. The relationship between the wavelength and frequency of electromagnetic radiation such as light is usually shown as a log-log plot ( (b)). Log-log plots are also commonly used to describe exponential functions, such as radioactive decay. (a) The Richter scale uses a log base 10 scale on its y-axis (microns of amplified maximum ground motion). (b) The relationship between the frequency and wavelength of electromagnetic radiation can be plotted as a straight line if a log-log plot is used. Method of Adding Percents: Shingling Your RoofA series of shingles are used to protect the roof of a home. Using a measuring tape, you measure one shingle and find its dimensions to be 44 cm by 100 cm. Knowing that your measurements are not perfect, you estimate an uncertainty of ±0.5 cm. Following the method of adding percents, what is the area of the shingle, including uncertainty? StrategyWhile calculating the area of the shingle is straightforward (44 cm x 100 cm = 4400 cm2), determining the percent uncertainty is more challenging. In order to use the method of adding percents, you must first calculate the percent uncertainty of each measurement. SolutionLength % Uncertainty: 𝜹A/A x 100% = 0.5/44 x 100% = 1.1% Width % Uncertainty: 𝜹A/A x 100% = 0.5/100 x 100% = 0.5% Adding Percents: 1.1% + 0.5% = 1.6% uncertainty Area of the Shingle: 4400 cm2 ± 1.6% Note that this uncertainty can also be expressed in metric terms. 1.6% x 4400 cm2 = 70.4 cm2 Area of the Shingle: 4400 ± 70.4 cm2 Discussion Knowing the percent uncertainty of a shingle can help a contractor determine the number of shingles needed, and therefore the cost, of roofing a new home. Consider how using smaller shingles would affect this uncertainty, and what role this would play in the cost estimation process. Graphing Lines In this simulation you will examine how changing the slope and y-intercept of an equation changes the appearance of a plotted line. Select slope-intercept form and drag the blue circles along the line to change the line’s characteristics. Then, play the line game and see if you can determine the slope or y-intercept of a given line. How would the following changes affect a line that is neither horizontal nor vertical and has a positive slope? increase the slope but keeping the y-intercept constant increase the y-intercept but keeping the slope constant Increasing the slope will cause the line to rotate clockwise around the y-intercept. Increasing the y-intercept will cause the line to move vertically up on the graph without changing the lines slope. Increasing the slope will cause the line to rotate counter-clockwise around the y-intercept. Increasing the y-intercept will cause the line to move vertically up on the graph without changing the lines slope. Increasing the slope will cause the line to rotate clockwise around the y-intercept. Increasing the y-intercept will cause the line to move horizontally right on the graph without changing the lines slope. Increasing the slope will cause the line to rotate counter-clockwise around the y-intercept. Increasing the y-intercept will cause the line to move horizontally right on the graph without changing the lines slope.

Section Summary Physical quantities are a characteristic or property of an object that can be measured or calculated from other measurements. The four fundamental units we will use in this textbook are the meter (for length), the kilogram (for mass), the second (for time), and the ampere (for electric current). These units are part of the metric system, which uses powers of 10 to relate quantities over the vast ranges encountered in nature. Unit conversions involve changing a value expressed in one type of unit to another type of unit. This is done by using conversion factors, which are ratios relating equal quantities of different units. Accuracy of a measured value refers to how close a measurement is to the correct value. The uncertainty in a measurement is an estimate of the amount by which the measurement result may differ from this value. Precision of measured values refers to how close the agreement is between repeated measurements. Significant figures express the precision of a measuring tool. When multiplying or dividing measured values, the final answer can contain only as many significant figures as the least precise value. When adding or subtracting measured values, the final answer cannot contain more decimal places than the least precise value. Key Equations slope intercept form y=mx+b quadratic formula y=a x 2 +bx+c positive exponential formula y= a x negative exponential formula y= a −x Concept Items How does the independent variable in a graph differ from the dependent variable? The dependent variable varies linearly with the independent variable. The dependent variable depends on the scale of the axis chosen while independent variable does not. The independent variable is directly manipulated or controlled by the person doing the experiment, while dependent variable is the one that changes as a result. The dependent and independent variables are fixed by a convention and hence they are the same. Velocity, or speed, is measured using the following formula: v = d t , where v is velocity, d is the distance travelled, and t is the time the object took to travel the distance. If the velocity-time data are plotted on a graph, which variable will be on which axis? Why? Time would be on the x-axis and velocity on the y-axis, because time is an independent variable and velocity is a dependent variable. Velocity would be on the x-axis and time on the y-axis, because time is the independent variable and velocity is the dependent variable. Time would be on the x-axis and velocity on the y-axis, because time is a dependent variable and velocity is a independent variable. Velocity would be on x-axis and time on the y-axis, because time is a dependent variable and velocity is a independent variable. Problems A commemorative coin that sells for $40 is advertised to be plated with 15 mg of gold. Suppose gold is worth about $1,300 per ounce. Which of the following best represents the value of the gold in the coin? $0.33 $0.69 $3.30 $6.90 The correct answer is (b).

Your unit should be described using at least two subunits. For example, you can decide to measure the quality of songs using a new unit called song awesomeness. Song awesomeness is measured by: the number of songs downloaded and the number of times the song was used in movies. Create an equation that shows how to calculate your unit. Then, using your equation, create a sample dataset that you could graph. Are your two subunits related linearly, quadratically, or inversely?

(Alex Needham, Public Domain) Teacher Support Have the students describe the photo of the train and discuss its motion. Tell them they will learn about motion. Start the discussion with how a train moves, and guide them toward discussing concepts of displacement, velocity, and acceleration. Ask questions: How do we know something is moving? What defines motion? What direction does the train move? What adjectives describe its motion? If it was a moving ball instead of a train, how would its motion be different? How would the train’s motion change if its wheels were square instead of round or if it had studded tires? Try to uncover what ideas students already have about motion. Outside of an airplane, have you ever traveled faster than 150 mph? Can you imagine traveling in a train like the one shown in that goes close to 300 mph? Despite the high speed, the people riding in this train may not notice that they are moving at all unless they look out the window! This is because motion, even motion at 300 mph, is relative to the observer. In this chapter, you will learn why it is important to identify a reference frame in order to clearly describe motion. For now, the motion you describe will be one-dimensional. Within this context, you will learn the difference between distance and displacement as well as the difference between speed and velocity. Then you will look at some graphing and problem-solving techniques.

Demonstrate how to convert from km/h to m/s. Demonstrate how to average two numbers by dividing their sum by 2.

The student is expected to: (B) describe and analyze motion in one dimension using equations with the concepts of distance, displacement, speed, average velocity, instantaneous velocity, and acceleration; (F) identify and describe motion relative to different frames of reference. Section Key Terms displacement distance kinematics magnitude position reference frame scalar vector Teacher Support [BL][OL] Start by asking what position is and how it is defined. You can use a toy car or other object. Then ask how they know the object has moved. Lead them to the idea of a defined starting point. Then bring in the concept of a numbered line as a way of quantifying motion. [AL] Ask students to describe the path of movement and emphasize that direction is a necessary component of a definition of motion. Ask the students to form pairs, and ask each pair to come up with their own definition of motion. Then compare and discuss definitions as a class. What components are necessary for a definition of motion? Defining Motion Our study of physics opens with kinematics—the study of motion without considering its causes. Objects are in motion everywhere you look. Everything from a tennis game to a space-probe flyby of the planet Neptune involves motion. When you are resting, your heart moves blood through your veins. Even in inanimate objects, atoms are always moving. How do you know something is moving? The location of an object at any particular time is its position. More precisely, you need to specify its position relative to a convenient reference frame. Earth is often used as a reference frame, and we often describe the position of an object as it relates to stationary objects in that reference frame. For example, a rocket launch would be described in terms of the position of the rocket with respect to Earth as a whole, while a professor’s position could be described in terms of where she is in relation to the nearby white board. In other cases, we use reference frames that are not stationary but are in motion relative to Earth. To describe the position of a person in an airplane, for example, we use the airplane, not Earth, as the reference frame. (See .) Thus, you can only know how fast and in what direction an object's position is changing against a background of something else that is either not moving or moving with a known speed and direction. The reference frame is the coordinate system from which the positions of objects are described. Are clouds a useful reference frame for airplane passengers? Why or why not? (Paul Brennan, Public Domain) Teacher Support [OL][AL]Explain that the word kinematics comes from a Greek term meaning motion. It is related to other English words, such as cinema (movies, or moving pictures) and kinesiology (the study of human motion). Your classroom can be used as a reference frame. In the classroom, the walls are not moving. Your motion as you walk to the door, can be measured against the stationary background of the classroom walls. You can also tell if other things in the classroom are moving, such as your classmates entering the classroom or a book falling off a desk. You can also tell in what direction something is moving in the classroom. You might say, “The teacher is moving toward the door.” Your reference frame allows you to determine not only that something is moving but also the direction of motion. You could also serve as a reference frame for others’ movement. If you remained seated as your classmates left the room, you would measure their movement away from your stationary location. If you and your classmates left the room together, then your perspective of their motion would be change. You, as the reference frame, would be moving in the same direction as your other moving classmates. As you will learn in the Snap Lab, your description of motion can be quite different when viewed from different reference frames. Teacher Support [BL][OL] You may want to introduce the concept of a reference point as the starting point of motion. Relate this to the origin of a coordinate grid. [AL] Explain that the reference frames considered in this chapter are inertial reference frames, which means they are not accelerating. Engage students in a discussion of how it is the difference in motion between the reference frame of the observer and the reference frame of the object that is important in describing motion. The reference frames used in this chapter might be moving at a constant speed relative to each other, but they are not accelerating relative to each other.[BL][OL][Visual] Misconception: Students may assume that a reference frame is a background of motion instead of the frame from which motion is viewed. Demonstrate the difference by having one student stand at the front of the class. Explain that this student represents the background. Walk once across the room between the student and the rest of the class. Ask the student and others in the class to describe the direction of your motion. The class might describe your motion as to the right, but the student who is standing as a background to your motion would describe the motion as to the left. Conclude by reminding students that the reference frame is the viewpoint of the observer, not the background. [BL] Have students practice describing simple examples of motion in the class from different reference frames. For example, slide a book across a desk. Ask students to describe its motion from their reference point, from the book's reference point, and from another student's reference point. Looking at Motion from Two Reference Frames In this activity you will look at motion from two reference frames. Which reference frame is correct? Choose an open location with lots of space to spread out so there is less chance of tripping or falling due to a collision and/or loose basketballs. 1 basketball Procedure Work with a partner. Stand a couple of meters away from your partner. Have your partner turn to the side so that you are looking at your partner’s profile. Have your partner begin bouncing the basketball while standing in place. Describe the motion of the ball. Next, have your partner again bounce the ball, but this time your partner should walk forward with the bouncing ball. You will remain stationary. Describe the ball's motion. Again have your partner walk forward with the bouncing ball. This time, you should move alongside your partner while continuing to view your partner’s profile. Describe the ball's motion. Switch places with your partner, and repeat Steps 1–3. How do the different reference frames affect how you describe the motion of the ball? The motion of the ball is independent of the reference frame and is same for different reference frames. The motion of the ball is independent of the reference frame and is different for different reference frames. The motion of the ball is dependent on the reference frame and is same for different reference frames. The motion of the ball is dependent on the reference frames and is different for different reference frames. Teacher Support Before students begin the lab, arrange a location where pairs of students can have ample room to walk forward at least several meters. As students work through the lab, encourage lab partners to discuss their observations. In Steps 1 and 3, students should observe the ball move straight up and straight down. In Step 2, students should observe the ball in a zigzag path away from the stationary observer. After the lab, lead students in discussing their observations. Ask them which reference frame is the correct one. Then emphasize that there is not a single correct reference frame. All reference frames are equally valid. History: Galileo's Ship Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) studied motion and developed the concept of a reference frame. (Domenico Tintoretto) The idea that a description of motion depends on the reference frame of the observer has been known for hundreds of years. The 17th-century astronomer Galileo Galilei () was one of the first scientists to explore this idea. Galileo suggested the following thought experiment: Imagine a windowless ship moving at a constant speed and direction along a perfectly calm sea. Is there a way that a person inside the ship can determine whether the ship is moving? You can extend this thought experiment by also imagining a person standing on the shore. How can a person on the shore determine whether the ship is moving? Galileo came to an amazing conclusion. Only by looking at each other can a person in the ship or a person on shore describe the motion of one relative to the other. In addition, their descriptions of motion would be symmetric or opposite. A person inside the ship would describe the person on the land as moving past the ship. The person on shore would describe the ship and the person inside it as moving past. Galileo realized that observers moving at a constant speed and direction relative to each other describe motion in the same way. Galileo had discovered that a description of motion is only meaningful if you specify a reference frame. Distance vs. Displacement As we study the motion of objects, we must first be able to describe the object’s position. Before your parent drives you to school, the car is sitting in your driveway. Your driveway is the starting position for the car. When you reach your high school, the car has changed position. Its new position is your school. Your total change in position is measured from your house to your school.Physicists use variables to represent terms. We will use d to represent car’s position. We will use a subscript to differentiate between the initial position, d0, and the final position, df. In addition, vectors, which we will discuss later, will be in bold or will have an arrow above the variable. Scalars will be italicized. In some books, x or s is used instead of d to describe position. In d0, said d naught, the subscript 0 stands for initial. When we begin to talk about two-dimensional motion, sometimes other subscripts will be used to describe horizontal position, dx, or vertical position, dy. So, you might see references to d0x and dfy. Now imagine driving from your house to a friend's house located several kilometers away. How far would you drive? The distance an object moves is the length of the path between its initial position and its final position. The distance you drive to your friend's house depends on your path. As shown in , distance is different from the length of a straight line between two points. The distance you drive to your friend's house is probably longer than the straight line between the two houses. A short line separates the starting and ending points of this motion, but the distance along the path of motion is considerably longer. We often want to be more precise when we talk about position. The description of an object’s motion often includes more than just the distance it moves. For instance, if it is a five kilometer drive to school, the distance traveled is 5 kilometers. After dropping you off at school and driving back home, your parent will have traveled a total distance of 10 kilometers. The car and your parent will end up in the same starting position in space. The net change in position of an object is its displacement, or Δ d. The Greek letter delta, Δ , means change in. The total distance that your car travels is 10 km, but the total displacement is 0. Teacher Support Help students learn the difference between distance and displacement by showing examples of motion. As students watch, walk straight across the room and have students estimate the length of your path. Then, at same starting point, walk along a winding path to the same ending point. Again, have students estimate the length of your path. Ask—Which motion showed displacement? Which showed distance? Point out that the first motion shows displacement, and the second shows distance along a path. In both cases, the starting and ending points were the same. [OL] Be careful that students do not assume that initial position is always zero. Emphasize that although initial position is often zero, motion can start from any position relative to a starting point. [Visual] Demonstrate positive and negative displacement by placing two meter sticks on the ground with their zero marks end-to-end. As students watch, place a small car at the zero mark. Slowly move the car to students' right a short distance and ask students what its displacement is. Then move the car to the left of the zero mark. Point out that the car now has a negative displacement. Students will learn more about vectors and scalars later when they study two-dimensional motion. For now, it is sufficient to introduce the terms and let students know that a vector includes information about direction. [BL] Ask students whether each of the following is a vector quantity or a scalar quantity: temperature (scalar), force (vector), mass (scalar). [OL] Ask students to provide examples of vector quantities and scalar quantities. [Kinesthetic] Provide students with large arrows cut from construction paper. Have them use the arrows to identify the magnitude (number or length of arrows) and direction of displacement. Emphasize that distance cannot be represented by arrows because distance does not include direction. Distance vs. Displacement In this activity you will compare distance and displacement. Which term is more useful when making measurements? 1 recorded song available on a portable device 1 tape measure 3 pieces of masking tape A room (like a gym) with a wall that is large and clear enough for all pairs of students to walk back and forth without running into each other. Procedure One student from each pair should stand with their back to the longest wall in the classroom. Students should stand at least 0.5 meters away from each other. Mark this starting point with a piece of masking tape. The second student from each pair should stand facing their partner, about two to three meters away. Mark this point with a second piece of masking tape. Student pairs line up at the starting point along the wall. The teacher turns on the music. Each pair walks back and forth from the wall to the second marked point until the music stops playing. Keep count of the number of times you walk across the floor. When the music stops, mark your ending position with the third piece of masking tape. Measure from your starting, initial position to your ending, final position. Measure the length of your path from the starting position to the second marked position. Multiply this measurement by the total number of times you walked across the floor. Then add this number to your measurement from step 6. Compare the two measurements from steps 6 and 7. Teacher Support Choose a room that is large enough for all students to walk unobstructed. Make sure the total path traveled is short enough that students can walk back and forth across it multiple times during the course of a song. Have them measure the distance between the two points and come to a consensus. When students measure their displacement, make sure that they measure forward from the direction they marked as the starting position. After they have completed the lab, have them discuss their results. If you are describing only your drive to school and the route is a straight line, then the distance traveled and the displacement are the same—5 kilometers. When you are describing the entire round trip, distance and displacement are different. When you describe distance, you only include the magnitude, the size or amount, of the distance traveled. However, when you describe the displacement, you take into account both the magnitude of the change in position and the direction of movement. In our previous example, the car travels a total of 10 kilometers, but it drives five of those kilometers forward toward school and five of those kilometers back in the opposite direction. If we ascribe the forward direction a positive (+) and the opposite direction a negative (–), then the two quantities will cancel each other out when added together. A quantity, such as distance, that has magnitude (i.e., how big or how much) and sometimes a sign (e.g., electric charge, temperature in Celsius, or component of a vector) but does not take into account direction is called a scalar. A quantity, such as displacement, that has both magnitude and direction is called a vector. A vector with magnitude zero is a special case of a vector that has no direction. Vectors & Scalars This video introduces and differentiates between vectors and scalars. It also introduces quantities that we will be working with during the study of kinematics. Teacher Support Define the concepts of vectors and scalars before watching the video. [OL][BL] Come up with some examples of vectors and scalars and have the students classify each. [AL] Discuss how the concept of direction might be important for the study of motion. Displacement ProblemsHopefully you now understand the conceptual difference between distance and displacement. Understanding concepts is half the battle in physics. The other half is math. A stumbling block to new physics students is trying to wade through the math of physics while also trying to understand the associated concepts. This struggle may lead to misconceptions and answers that make no sense. Once the concept is mastered, the math is far less confusing. So let’s review and see if we can make sense of displacement in terms of numbers and equations. You can calculate an object's displacement by subtracting its original position, d0, from its final position df. In math terms that means Δd= d f − d 0 . If the final position is the same as the initial position, then Δd=0 . To assign numbers and/or direction to these quantities, we need to define an axis with a positive and a negative direction. We also need to define an origin, or O. In , the axis is in a straight line with home at zero and school in the positive direction. If we left home and drove the opposite way from school, motion would have been in the negative direction. We would have assigned it a negative value. In the round-trip drive, df and d0 were both at zero kilometers. In the one way trip to school, df was at 5 kilometers and d0 was at zero km. So, Δd was 5 kilometers. You may place your origin wherever you would like. You have to make sure that you calculate all distances consistently from your zero and you define one direction as positive and the other as negative. Therefore, it makes sense to choose the easiest axis, direction, and zero. In the example above, we took home to be zero because it allowed us to avoid having to interpret a solution with a negative sign. Calculating Distance and Displacement A cyclist rides 3 km west and then turns around and rides 2 km east. (a) What is her displacement? (b) What distance does she ride? (c) What is the magnitude of her displacement? Strategy To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the final position and the initial position while taking care to note the direction on the axis. The final position is the sum of the two displacements, Δ d 1 and Δ d 2 . Solution Displacement: The rider’s displacement is Δ d= d f − d 0 =−1 km . Distance: The distance traveled is 3 km + 2 km = 5 km. The magnitude of the displacement is 1 km. Discussion The displacement is negative because we chose east to be positive and west to be negative. We could also have described the displacement as 1 km west. When calculating displacement, the direction mattered, but when calculating distance, the direction did not matter. The problem would work the same way if the problem were in the north–south or y-direction. Physicists like to use standard units so it is easier to compare notes. The standard units for calculations are called SI units (International System of Units). SI units are based on the metric system. The SI unit for displacement is the meter (m), but sometimes you will see a problem with kilometers, miles, feet, or other units of length. If one unit in a problem is an SI unit and another is not, you will need to convert all of your quantities to the same system before you can carry out the calculation. Teacher Support Point out to students that the distance for each segment is the absolute value of the displacement along a straight path. Practice Problems On an axis in which moving from right to left is positive, what is the displacement and distance of a student who walks 32 m to the right and then 17 m to the left? Displacement is -15 m and distance is -49 m. Displacement is -15 m and distance is 49 m. Displacement is 15 m and distance is -49 m. Displacement is 15 m and distance is 49 m. Tiana jogs 1.5 km along a straight path and then turns and jogs 2.4 km in the opposite direction. She then turns back and jogs 0.7 km in the original direction. Let Tianas original direction be the positive direction. What are the displacement and distance she jogged? Displacement is 4.6 km,and distance is -0.2 km. Displacement is -0.2 km, and distance is 4.6 km. Displacement is 4.6 km, and distance is +0.2 km. Displacement is +0.2 km, and distance is 4.6 km. Mars Probe Explosion The Mars Climate Orbiter disaster illustrates the importance of using the correct calculations in physics. (NASA)Physicists make calculations all the time, but they do not always get the right answers. In 1998, NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, launched the Mars Climate Orbiter, shown in , a $125-million-dollar satellite designed to monitor the Martian atmosphere. It was supposed to orbit the planet and take readings from a safe distance. The American scientists made calculations in English units (feet, inches, pounds, etc.) and forgot to convert their answers to the standard metric SI units. This was a very costly mistake. Instead of orbiting the planet as planned, the Mars Climate Orbiter ended up flying into the Martian atmosphere. The probe disintegrated. It was one of the biggest embarrassments in NASA’s history. Teacher Support The text feature describes a real-life miscalculation made by astronomers at NASA. In this case, the Mars Climate Orbiter’s orbit needed to be calculated precisely because its machinery was designed to withstand only a certain amount of atmospheric pressure. The orbiter had to be close enough to the planet to take measurements and far enough away that it could remain structurally sound. One way to teach this concept would be to pick an orbital distance from Mars and have the students calculate the distance of the path and the height from the surface both in SI units and in English units. Ask why failure to convert might be a problem. Check Your Understanding What does it mean when motion is described as relative? It means that motion of any object is described relative to the motion of Earth. It means that motion of any object is described relative to the motion of any other object. It means that motion is independent of the frame of reference. It means that motion depends on the frame of reference selected. Teacher Support Use the questions under Check Your Understanding to assess students’ achievement of the section’s learning objectives. If students are struggling with a specific objective, the formative assessment will help direct students to the relevant content. Section Summary A description of motion depends on the reference frame from which it is described. The distance an object moves is the length of the path along which it moves. Displacement is the difference in the initial and final positions of an object. Key Equations Displacement Δ d= d f − d 0 Concept Items In which example would you be correct in describing an object in motion while your friend would also be correct in describing that same object as being at rest? You are driving a car toward the east and your friend drives past you in the opposite direction with the same speed. In your frame of reference, you will be in motion. In your friends frame of reference, you will be at rest. You are driving a car toward the east and your friend is standing at the bus stop. In your frame of reference, you will be in motion. In your friends frame of reference, you will be at rest. You are driving a car toward the east and your friend is standing at the bus stop. In your frame of reference, your friend will be moving toward the west. In your friends frame of reference, he will be at rest. You are driving a car toward the east and your friend is standing at the bus stop. In your frame of reference, your friend will be moving toward the east. In your friends frame of reference, he will be at rest. Critical Thinking Problems Billy drops a ball from a height of 1 m. The ball bounces back to a height of 0.8 m, then bounces again to a height of 0.5 m, and bounces once more to a height of 0.2 m. Up is the positive direction. What are the total displacement of the ball and the total distance traveled by the ball? The displacement is equal to –4 m and the distance is equal to 4 m. The displacement is equal to –1 m and the distance is equal to 1 m The displacement is equal to 4 m and the distance is equal to 1 m. The displacement is equal to –1 m and the distance is equal to 4 m. Test Prep Multiple Choice If a space shuttle orbits Earth once, what is the shuttles distance traveled and displacement? Distance and displacement both are zero. Distance is circumference of the circular orbit while displacement is zero. Distance is zero while the displacement is circumference of the circular orbit. Distance and displacement both are equal to circumference of the circular orbit. Test Prep Short Answer While standing on a sidewalk facing the road, you see a bicyclist passing by toward your right.

The student knows and applies the laws governing motion in a variety of situations. The student is expected to: (B) describe and analyze motion in one dimension using equations with the concepts of distance, displacement, speed, average velocity, instantaneous velocity, and acceleration. In addition, the High School Physics Laboratory Manual addresses content in this section in the lab titled: Position and Speed of an Object, as well as the following standards:(4) Science concepts. The student knows and applies the laws governing motion in a variety of situations. The student is expected to: (B) describe and analyze motion in one dimension using equations with the concepts of distance, displacement, speed, average velocity, instantaneous velocity, and acceleration. Section Key Terms average speed average velocity instantaneous speed instantaneous velocity speed velocity Teacher Support In this section, students will apply what they have learned about distance and displacement to the concepts of speed and velocity. [BL][OL] Before students read the section, ask them to give examples of ways they have heard the word speed used. Then ask them if they have heard the word velocity used. Explain that these words are often used interchangeably in everyday life, but their scientific definitions are different. Tell students that they will learn about these differences as they read the section. [AL] Explain to students that velocity, like displacement, is a vector quantity. Ask them to speculate about ways that speed is different from velocity. After they share their ideas, follow up with questions that deepen their thought process, such as: Why do you think that? What is an example? How might apply these terms to motion that you see every day? Speed There is more to motion than distance and displacement. Questions such as, “How long does a foot race take?” and “What was the runner’s speed?” cannot be answered without an understanding of other concepts. In this section we will look at time, speed, and velocity to expand our understanding of motion. A description of how fast or slow an object moves is its speed. Speed is the rate at which an object changes its location. Like distance, speed is a scalar because it has a magnitude but not a direction. Because speed is a rate, it depends on the time interval of motion. You can calculate the elapsed time or the change in time, Δt , of motion as the difference between the ending time and the beginning time Δt= t f − t 0 . The SI unit of time is the second (s), and the SI unit of speed is meters per second (m/s), but sometimes kilometers per hour (km/h), miles per hour (mph) or other units of speed are used. When you describe an object's speed, you often describe the average over a time period. Average speed, vavg, is the distance traveled divided by the time during which the motion occurs. v avg = distance time You can, of course, rearrange the equation to solve for either distance or time time = distance v avg . distance = v avg × time Suppose, for example, a car travels 150 kilometers in 3.2 hours. Its average speed for the trip is v avg = distance time = 150 km 3.2 h = 47 km/h. A car's speed would likely increase and decrease many times over a 3.2 hour trip. Its speed at a specific instant in time, however, is its instantaneous speed. A car's speedometer describes its instantaneous speed. Teacher Support [OL][AL] Caution students that average speed is not always the average of an object's initial and final speeds. For example, suppose a car travels a distance of 100 km. The first 50 km it travels 30 km/h and the second 50 km it travels at 60 km/h. Its average speed would be distance /(time interval) = (100 km)/[(50 km)/(30 km/h) + (50 km)/(60 km/h)] = 40 km/h. If the car had spent equal times at 30 km and 60 km rather than equal distances at these speeds, its average speed would have been 45 km/h. [BL][OL] Caution students that the terms speed, average speed, and instantaneous speed are all often referred to simply as speed in everyday language. Emphasize the importance in science to use correct terminology to avoid confusion and to properly communicate ideas. During a 30-minute round trip to the store, the total distance traveled is 6 km. The average speed is 12 km/h. The displacement for the round trip is zero, because there was no net change in position. Calculating Average Speed A marble rolls 5.2 m in 1.8 s. What was the marble's average speed? Strategy We know the distance the marble travels, 5.2 m, and the time interval, 1.8 s. We can use these values in the average speed equation. Solution v avg = distance time = 5.2 m 1.8 s =2.9 m/s Discussion Average speed is a scalar, so we do not include direction in the answer. We can check the reasonableness of the answer by estimating: 5 meters divided by 2 seconds is 2.5 m/s. Since 2.5 m/s is close to 2.9 m/s, the answer is reasonable. This is about the speed of a brisk walk, so it also makes sense. Practice Problems A pitcher throws a baseball from the pitchers mound to home plate in 0.46 s. The distance is 18.4 m. What was the average speed of the baseball? 40 m/s - 40 m/s 0.03 m/s 8.5 m/s Velocity The vector version of speed is velocity. Velocity describes the speed and direction of an object. As with speed, it is useful to describe either the average velocity over a time period or the velocity at a specific moment. Average velocity is displacement divided by the time over which the displacement occurs. v avg = displacement time = Δd Δt = d f − d 0 t f − t 0 Velocity, like speed, has SI units of meters per second (m/s), but because it is a vector, you must also include a direction. Furthermore, the variable v for velocity is bold because it is a vector, which is in contrast to the variable v for speed which is italicized because it is a scalar quantity. It is important to keep in mind that the average speed is not the same thing as the average velocity without its direction. Like we saw with displacement and distance in the last section, changes in direction over a time interval have a bigger effect on speed and velocity. Suppose a passenger moved toward the back of a plane with an average velocity of –4 m/s. We cannot tell from the average velocity whether the passenger stopped momentarily or backed up before he got to the back of the plane. To get more details, we must consider smaller segments of the trip over smaller time intervals such as those shown in . If you consider infinitesimally small intervals, you can define instantaneous velocity, which is the velocity at a specific instant in time. Instantaneous velocity and average velocity are the same if the velocity is constant. The diagram shows a more detailed record of an airplane passenger heading toward the back of the plane, showing smaller segments of his trip.Earlier, you have read that distance traveled can be different than the magnitude of displacement. In the same way, speed can be different than the magnitude of velocity. For example, you drive to a store and return home in half an hour. If your car’s odometer shows the total distance traveled was 6 km, then your average speed was 12 km/h. Your average velocity, however, was zero because your displacement for the round trip is zero. Calculating Average Velocity or Speed This video reviews vectors and scalars and describes how to calculate average velocity and average speed when you know displacement and change in time. The video also reviews how to convert km/h to m/s. Teacher Support This video does a good job of reinforcing the difference between vectors and scalars. The student is introduced to the idea of using ‘s’ to denote displacement, which you may or may not wish to encourage. Before students watch the video, point out that the instructor uses s→ for displacement instead of d, as used in this text. Explain the use of small arrows over variables is a common way to denote vectors in higher-level physics courses. Caution students that the customary abbreviations for hour and seconds are not used in this video. Remind students that in their own work they should use the abbreviations h for hour and s for seconds. Calculating Average Velocity A student has a displacement of 304 m north in 180 s. What was the student's average velocity? Strategy We know that the displacement is 304 m north and the time is 180 s. We can use the formula for average velocity to solve the problem. Solution v avg = Δd Δt = 304 m 180 s =1.7 m/s north Discussion Since average velocity is a vector quantity, you must include direction as well as magnitude in the answer. Notice, however, that the direction can be omitted until the end to avoid cluttering the problem. Pay attention to the significant figures in the problem. The distance 304 m has three significant figures, but the time interval 180 s has only two, so the quotient should have only two significant figures. Note the way scalars and vectors are represented. In this book d represents distance and displacement. Similarly, v represents speed, and v represents velocity. A variable that is not bold indicates a scalar quantity, and a bold variable indicates a vector quantity. Vectors are sometimes represented by small arrows above the variable. Teacher Support Use this problem to emphasize the importance of using the correct number of significant figures in calculations. Some students have a tendency to include many digits in their final calculations. They incorrectly believe they are improving the accuracy of their answer by writing many of the digits shown on the calculator. Point out that doing this introduces errors into the calculations. In more complicated calculations, these errors can propagate and cause the final answer to be wrong. Instead, remind students to always carry one or two extra digits in intermediate calculations and to round the final answer to the correct number of significant figures. Solving for Displacement when Average Velocity and Time are Known Layla jogs with an average velocity of 2.4 m/s east. What is her displacement after 46 seconds? Strategy We know that Layla's average velocity is 2.4 m/s east, and the time interval is 46 seconds. We can rearrange the average velocity formula to solve for the displacement. Solution v avg = Δd Δt Δd = v avg Δt = (2.4 m/s)(46 s) = 1.1× 10 2 m east Discussion The answer is about 110 m east, which is a reasonable displacement for slightly less than a minute of jogging. A calculator shows the answer as 110.4 m. We chose to write the answer using scientific notation because we wanted to make it clear that we only used two significant figures. Dimensional analysis is a good way to determine whether you solved a problem correctly. Write the calculation using only units to be sure they match on opposite sides of the equal mark. In the worked example, you have m = (m/s)(s). Since seconds is in the denominator for the average velocity and in the numerator for the time, the unit cancels out leaving only m and, of course, m = m. Solving for Time when Displacement and Average Velocity are Known Phillip walks along a straight path from his house to his school. How long will it take him to get to school if he walks 428 m west with an average velocity of 1.7 m/s west? Strategy We know that Phillip's displacement is 428 m west, and his average velocity is 1.7 m/s west. We can calculate the time required for the trip by rearranging the average velocity equation. Solution v avg = Δd Δt Δt = Δd v avg = 428 m 1.7 m/s = 2.5× 10 2 s Discussion Here again we had to use scientific notation because the answer could only have two significant figures. Since time is a scalar, the answer includes only a magnitude and not a direction. Practice Problems A bird flies with an average velocity of 7.5 m/s east from one branch to another in 2.4 s. It then pauses before flying with an average velocity of 6.8 m/s east for 3.5 s to another branch. What is the birds total displacement from its starting point? 42 m west 6 m west 6 m east 42 m east The Walking Man In this simulation you will put your cursor on the man and move him first in one direction and then in the opposite direction. Keep the Introduction tab active. You can use the Charts tab after you learn about graphing motion later in this chapter. Carefully watch the sign of the numbers in the position and velocity boxes. Ignore the acceleration box for now. See if you can make the man’s position positive while the velocity is negative. Then see if you can do the opposite. Which situation correctly describes when the moving mans position was negative but his velocity was positive? Man moving toward 0 from left of 0 Man moving toward 0 from right of 0 Man moving away from 0 from left of 0 Man moving away from 0 from right of 0 Teacher Support This is a powerful interactive animation, and it can be used for many lessons. At this point it can be used to show that displacement can be either positive or negative. It can also show that when displacement is negative, velocity can be either positive or negative. Later it can be used to show that velocity and acceleration can have different signs. It is strongly suggested that you keep students on the Introduction tab. The Charts tab can be used after students learn about graphing motion later in this chapter. Check Your Understanding If you divide the total distance traveled on a car trip (as determined by the odometer) by the time for the trip, are you calculating the average speed or the magnitude of the average velocity, and under what circumstances are these two quantities the same? Average speed. Both are the same when the car is traveling at a constant speed and changing direction. Average speed. Both are the same when the speed is constant and the car does not change its direction. Magnitude of average velocity. Both are same when the car is traveling at a constant speed. Magnitude of average velocity. Both are same when the car does not change its direction. Teacher Support Use the Check Your Understanding questions to assess students’ achievement of the sections learning objectives. If students are struggling with a specific objective, the Check Your Understanding will help identify which and direct students to the relevant content. Assessment items in TUTOR will allow you to reassess. Section Summary Average speed is a scalar quantity that describes distance traveled divided by the time during which the motion occurs. Velocity is a vector quantity that describes the speed and direction of an object. Average velocity is displacement over the time period during which the displacement occurs. If the velocity is constant, then average velocity and instantaneous velocity are the same.

Object is in linear motion with constant velocity. Object is moving at a constant speed. Object is either at rest or it returns to the initial point. Object is moving in a straight line without changing its direction. Test Prep Extended Response A father and his daughter go to the bus stop that is located 75 m from their front door. The father walks in a straight line while his daughter runs along a varied path. Despite the different paths, they both end up at the bus stop at the same time.

The student knows and applies the laws governing motion in a variety of situations. The student is expected to: (A) generate and interpret graphs and charts describing different types of motion, including the use of real-time technology such as motion detectors or photogates. Section Key Terms dependent variable independent variable tangent Teacher Support [BL][OL] Describe a scenario, for example, in which you launch a water rocket into the air. It goes up 150 ft, stops, and then falls back to the earth. Have the students assess the situation. Where would they put their zero? What is the positive direction, and what is the negative direction? Have a student draw a picture of the scenario on the board. Then draw a position vs. time graph describing the motion. Have students help you complete the graph. Is the line straight? Is it curved? Does it change direction? What can they tell by looking at the graph? [AL] Once the students have looked at and analyzed the graph, see if they can describe different scenarios in which the lines would be straight instead of curved? Where the lines would be discontinuous? Graphing Position as a Function of Time A graph, like a picture, is worth a thousand words. Graphs not only contain numerical information, they also reveal relationships between physical quantities. In this section, we will investigate kinematics by analyzing graphs of position over time. Graphs in this text have perpendicular axes, one horizontal and the other vertical. When two physical quantities are plotted against each other, the horizontal axis is usually considered the independent variable, and the vertical axis is the dependent variable. In algebra, you would have referred to the horizontal axis as the x-axis and the vertical axis as the y-axis. As in , a straight-line graph has the general form y=mx+b . Here m is the slope, defined as the rise divided by the run (as seen in the figure) of the straight line. The letter b is the y-intercept which is the point at which the line crosses the vertical, y-axis. In terms of a physical situation in the real world, these quantities will take on a specific significance, as we will see below. (.) The diagram shows a straight-line graph. The equation for the straight line is y equals mx + b. In physics, time is usually the independent variable. Other quantities, such as displacement, are said to depend upon it. A graph of position versus time, therefore, would have position on the vertical axis (dependent variable) and time on the horizontal axis (independent variable). In this case, to what would the slope and y-intercept refer? Let’s look back at our original example when studying distance and displacement. The drive to school was 5 km from home. Let’s assume it took 10 minutes to make the drive and that your parent was driving at a constant velocity the whole time. The position versus time graph for this section of the trip would look like that shown in . A graph of position versus time for the drive to school is shown. What would the graph look like if we added the return trip? As we said before, d0 = 0 because we call home our O and start calculating from there. In , the line starts at d = 0, as well. This is the b in our equation for a straight line. Our initial position in a position versus time graph is always the place where the graph crosses the x-axis at t = 0. What is the slope? The rise is the change in position, (i.e., displacement) and the run is the change in time. This relationship can also be written Δd Δt . This relationship was how we defined average velocity. Therefore, the slope in a d versus t graph, is the average velocity. Sometimes, as is the case where we graph both the trip to school and the return trip, the behavior of the graph looks different during different time intervals. If the graph looks like a series of straight lines, then you can calculate the average velocity for each time interval by looking at the slope. If you then want to calculate the average velocity for the entire trip, you can do a weighted average. Let’s look at another example. shows a graph of position versus time for a jet-powered car on a very flat dry lake bed in Nevada. The diagram shows a graph of position versus time for a jet-powered car on the Bonneville Salt Flats. Using the relationship between dependent and independent variables, we see that the slope in the graph in is average velocity, vavg and the intercept is displacement at time zero—that is, d0. Substituting these symbols into y = mx + b gives d=vt+ d 0 or d= d 0 +vt . Thus a graph of position versus time gives a general relationship among displacement, velocity, and time, as well as giving detailed numerical information about a specific situation. From the figure we can see that the car has a position of 400 m at t = 0 s, 650 m at t = 1.0 s, and so on. And we can learn about the object’s velocity, as well. Teacher Support Help students learn what different graphs of displacement vs. time look like. [Visual] Set up a meter stick. If you can find a remote control car, have one student record times as you send the car forward along the stick, then backwards, then forward again with a constant velocity. Take the recorded times and the change in position and put them together. Get the students to coach you to draw a position vs. time graph. Each leg of the journey should be a straight line with a different slope. The parts where the car was going forward should have a positive slope. The part where it is going backwards would have a negative slope. [OL] Ask if the place that they take as zero affects the graph. [AL] Is it realistic to draw any position graph that starts at rest without some curve in it? Why might we be able to neglect the curve in some scenarios? [All] Discuss what can be uncovered from this graph. Students should be able to read the net displacement, but they can also use the graph to determine the total distance traveled. Then ask how the speed or velocity is reflected in this graph. Direct students in seeing that the steepness of the line (slope) is a measure of the speed and that the direction of the slope is the direction of the motion. [AL] Some students might recognize that a curve in the line represents a sort of slope of the slope, a preview of acceleration which they will learn about in the next chapter. Graphing Motion In this activity, you will release a ball down a ramp and graph the ball’s displacement vs. time. Choose an open location with lots of space to spread out so there is less chance for tripping or falling due to rolling balls. 1 ball 1 board 2 or 3 books 1 stopwatch 1 tape measure 6 pieces of masking tape 1 piece of graph paper 1 pencil Procedure Build a ramp by placing one end of the board on top of the stack of books. Adjust location, as necessary, until there is no obstacle along the straight line path from the bottom of the ramp until at least the next 3 m. Mark distances of 0.5 m, 1.0 m, 1.5 m, 2.0 m, 2.5 m, and 3.0 m from the bottom of the ramp. Write the distances on the tape. Have one person take the role of the experimenter. This person will release the ball from the top of the ramp. If the ball does not reach the 3.0 m mark, then increase the incline of the ramp by adding another book. Repeat this Step as necessary. Have the experimenter release the ball. Have a second person, the timer, begin timing the trial once the ball reaches the bottom of the ramp and stop the timing once the ball reaches 0.5 m. Have a third person, the recorder, record the time in a data table. Repeat Step 4, stopping the times at the distances of 1.0 m, 1.5 m, 2.0 m, 2.5 m, and 3.0 m from the bottom of the ramp. Use your measurements of time and the displacement to make a position vs. time graph of the ball’s motion. Repeat Steps 4 through 6, with different people taking on the roles of experimenter, timer, and recorder. Do you get the same measurement values regardless of who releases the ball, measures the time, or records the result? Discuss possible causes of discrepancies, if any. Teacher Support [BL][OL] Emphasize that the motion in this lab is the motion of the ball as it rolls along the floor. Ask students where there zero should be. [AL] Ask students what the graph would look like if they began timing at the top versus the bottom of the ramp. Why would the graph look different? What might account for the difference?[BL][OL] Have the students compare the graphs made with different individuals taking on different roles. Ask them to determine and compare average speeds for each interval. What were the absolute differences in speeds, and what were the percent differences? Do the differences appear to be random, or are there systematic differences? Why might there be systematic differences between the two sets of measurements with different individuals in each role?[BL][OL] Have the students compare the graphs made with different individuals taking on different roles. Ask them to determine and compare average speeds for each interval. What were the absolute differences in speeds, and what were the percent differences? Do the differences appear to be random, or are there systematic differences? Why might there be systematic differences between the two sets of measurements with different individuals in each role? Solving Problems Using Position vs. Time Graphs So how do we use graphs to solve for things we want to know like velocity? Using Position–Time Graph to Calculate Average Velocity: Jet Car Find the average velocity of the car whose position is graphed in Figure 1.13. Strategy The slope of a graph of d vs. t is average velocity, since slope equals rise over run. slope = Δd Δt =v Since the slope is constant here, any two points on the graph can be used to find the slope. Solution Choose two points on the line. In this case, we choose the points labeled on the graph: (6.4 s, 2000 m) and (0.50 s, 525 m). (Note, however, that you could choose any two points.) Substitute the d and t values of the chosen points into the equation. Remember in calculating change (Δ) we always use final value minus initial value. v = Δd Δt = 2000 m−525 m 6.4 s−0.50 s = 250 m/s , Discussion This is an impressively high land speed (900 km/h, or about 560 mi/h): much greater than the typical highway speed limit of 27 m/s or 96 km/h, but considerably shy of the record of 343 m/s or 1,234 km/h, set in 1997. Teacher Support If the graph of position is a straight line, then the only thing students need to know to calculate the average velocity is the slope of the line, rise/run. They can use whichever points on the line are most convenient. But what if the graph of the position is more complicated than a straight line? What if the object speeds up or turns around and goes backward? Can we figure out anything about its velocity from a graph of that kind of motion? Let’s take another look at the jet-powered car. The graph in shows its motion as it is getting up to speed after starting at rest. Time starts at zero for this motion (as if measured with a stopwatch), and the displacement and velocity are initially 200 m and 15 m/s, respectively. The diagram shows a graph of the position of a jet-powered car during the time span when it is speeding up. The slope of a distance versus time graph is velocity. This is shown at two points. Instantaneous velocity at any point is the slope of the tangent at that point. A U.S. Air Force jet car speeds down a track. (Matt Trostle, Flickr) The graph of position versus time in is a curve rather than a straight line. The slope of the curve becomes steeper as time progresses, showing that the velocity is increasing over time. The slope at any point on a position-versus-time graph is the instantaneous velocity at that point. It is found by drawing a straight line tangent to the curve at the point of interest and taking the slope of this straight line. Tangent lines are shown for two points in . The average velocity is the net displacement divided by the time traveled. Using Position–Time Graph to Calculate Average Velocity: Jet Car, Take Two Calculate the instantaneous velocity of the jet car at a time of 25 s by finding the slope of the tangent line at point Q in . Strategy The slope of a curve at a point is equal to the slope of a straight line tangent to the curve at that point. Solution Find the tangent line to the curve at t=25 s . Determine the endpoints of the tangent. These correspond to a position of 1,300 m at time 19 s and a position of 3120 m at time 32 s. Plug these endpoints into the equation to solve for the slope, v. slope = v Q = Δ d Q Δ t Q = (3120−1300) m (32−19) s = 1820 m 13 s = 140 m/s Discussion The entire graph of v versus t can be obtained in this fashion. Teacher Support A curved line is a more complicated example. Define tangent as a line that touches a curve at only one point. Show that as a straight line changes its angle next to a curve, it actually hits the curve multiple times at the base, but only one line will never touch at all. This line forms a right angle to the radius of curvature, but at this level, they can just kind of eyeball it. The slope of this line gives the instantaneous velocity. The most useful part of this line is that students can tell when the velocity is increasing, decreasing, positive, negative, and zero. [AL] You could find the instantaneous velocity at each point along the graph and if you graphed each of those points, you would have a graph of the velocity. Practice Problems Calculate the average velocity of the object shown in the graph below over the whole time interval. 0.25 m/s 0.31 m/s 3.2 m/s 4.00 m/s Check Your Understanding Which of the following information about motion can be determined by looking at a position vs. time graph that is a straight line? frame of reference average acceleration velocity direction of force applied Teacher Support Use the Check Your Understanding questions to assess students’ achievement of the section’s learning objectives. If students are struggling with a specific objective, the Check Your Understanding will help identify direct students to the relevant content. Section Summary Graphs can be used to analyze motion. The slope of a position vs. time graph is the velocity. For a straight line graph of position, the slope is the average velocity. To obtain the instantaneous velocity at a given moment for a curved graph, find the tangent line at that point and take its slope. Key Equations Displacement d= d 0 +vt . Concept Items Use the graph to describe what the runner’s motion looks like. How are average velocity for only the first four seconds and instantaneous velocity related? What is the runner's net displacement over the time shown? The net displacement is 12 m and the average velocity is equal to the instantaneous velocity. The net displacement is 12 m and the average velocity is two times the instantaneous velocity. The net displacement is 10 + 12 = 22 m and the average velocity is equal to the instantaneous velocity. The net displacement is 10 + 12 = 22 m and the average velocity is two times the instantaneous velocity. Critical ThinkingExplain how you can use the graph of position vs. time to describe the change in velocity over time. Identify the time (ta, tb, tc, td, or te) at which at which the instantaneous velocity is greatest, the time at which it is zero, and the time at which it is negative. Problems Using the graph, what is the average velocity for the whole 10 seconds? The total average velocity is 0 m/s. The total average velocity is 1.2 m/s. The total average velocity is 1.5 m/s. The total average velocity is 3.0 m/s. Test Prep Multiple Choice What is the slope of a straight line graph of position vs. time?

Assume it does not slow until it is stopped by an opposing player who sends it back in the direction it came. The players are 20 m apart and it takes 1 s for the puck to go there and back. Which of the following describes the graph of the displacement over time? Consider the initial direction of the puck to be positive. The graph is an upward opening V. The graph is a downward opening V. The graph is an upward opening U. The graph is downward opening U. A defensive player kicks a soccer ball 20 m back to her own goalie. It stops just as it reaches her. She sends it back to the player. Without knowing the time it takes, draw a rough sketch of the displacement over time. Does this graph look similar to the graph of the hockey puck from the previous question? Yes, the graph is similar to the graph of the hockey puck. No, the graph is not similar to the graph of the hockey puck. The graphs cannot be compared without knowing the time the soccer ball was rolling. What are the net displacement, total distance traveled, and total average velocity in the previous two problems? net displacement = 0 m, total distance = 20 m, total average velocity = 20 m/s net displacement = 0 m, total distance = 40 m, total average velocity = 20 m/s net displacement = 0 m, total distance = 20 m, total average velocity = 0 m/s net displacement = 0 m, total distance = 40 m, total average velocity = 0 m/s Test Prep Extended Response What kind of motion would create a position graph like the one shown? uniform motion any motion that accelerates motion that stops and then starts motion that has constant velocity What is the average velocity for the whole time period shown in the graph? – 1 3 m/s – 3 4 m/s 1 3 m/s 3 4 m/s dependent variable the variable that changes as the independent variable changes independent variable the variable, usually along the horizontal axis of a graph, that does not change based on human or experimental action; in physics this is usually time tangent a line that touches another at exactly one point", "formulas": [], "subsections": [], "extraction_stats": {"chapters_found": 23, "text_length": 1895072, "modules_processed": 98}, "content_hash": "93f89c3db3e2c9ab6f8204866c429cdc", "section_index": 3, "total_sections": 5}

The student knows and applies the laws governing motion in a variety of situations. The student is expected to: (A) generate and interpret graphs and charts describing different types of motion, including the use of real-time technology such as motion detectors or photogates. Section Key Terms acceleration Teacher Support Ask students to use their knowledge of position graphs to construct velocity vs. time graphs. Alternatively, provide an example of a velocity vs. time graph and ask students what information can be derived from the graph. Ask—Is it the same information as in a position vs. time graph? How is the information portrayed differently? Is there any new information in a velocity vs. time graph? Graphing Velocity as a Function of Time Earlier, we examined graphs of position versus time. Now, we are going to build on that information as we look at graphs of velocity vs. time. Velocity is the rate of change of displacement. Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity; we will discuss acceleration more in another chapter. These concepts are all very interrelated. Maze Game In this simulation you will use a vector diagram to manipulate a ball into a certain location without hitting a wall. You can manipulate the ball directly with position or by changing its velocity. Explore how these factors change the motion. If you would like, you can put it on the a setting, as well. This is acceleration, which measures the rate of change of velocity. We will explore acceleration in more detail later, but it might be interesting to take a look at it here. What can we learn about motion by looking at velocity vs. time graphs? Let’s return to our drive to school, and look at a graph of position versus time as shown in . A graph of position versus time for the drive to and from school is shown.We assumed for our original calculation that your parent drove with a constant velocity to and from school. We now know that the car could not have gone from rest to a constant velocity without speeding up. So the actual graph would be curved on either end, but let’s make the same approximation as we did then, anyway. It is common in physics, especially at the early learning stages, for certain things to be neglected, as we see here. This is because it makes the concept clearer or the calculation easier. Practicing physicists use these kinds of short-cuts, as well. It works out because usually the thing being neglected is small enough that it does not significantly affect the answer. In the earlier example, the amount of time it takes the car to speed up and reach its cruising velocity is very small compared to the total time traveled. Looking at this graph, and given what we learned, we can see that there are two distinct periods to the car’s motion—the way to school and the way back. The average velocity for the drive to school is 0.5 km/minute. We can see that the average velocity for the drive back is –0.5 km/minute. If we plot the data showing velocity versus time, we get another graph (): Graph of velocity versus time for the drive to and from school.We can learn a few things. First, we can derive a v versus t graph from a d versus t graph. Second, if we have a straight-line position–time graph that is positively or negatively sloped, it will yield a horizontal velocity graph. There are a few other interesting things to note. Just as we could use a position vs. time graph to determine velocity, we can use a velocity vs. time graph to determine position. We know that v = d/t. If we use a little algebra to re-arrange the equation, we see that d = v × t. In , we have velocity on the y-axis and time along the x-axis. Let’s take just the first half of the motion. We get 0.5 km/minute × 10 minutes. The units for minutes cancel each other, and we get 5 km, which is the displacement for the trip to school. If we calculate the same for the return trip, we get –5 km. If we add them together, we see that the net displacement for the whole trip is 0 km, which it should be because we started and ended at the same place. You can treat units just like you treat numbers, so a km/km=1 (or, we say, it cancels out). This is good because it can tell us whether or not we have calculated everything with the correct units. For instance, if we end up with m × s for velocity instead of m/s, we know that something has gone wrong, and we need to check our math. This process is called dimensional analysis, and it is one of the best ways to check if your math makes sense in physics. The area under a velocity curve represents the displacement. The velocity curve also tells us whether the car is speeding up. In our earlier example, we stated that the velocity was constant. So, the car is not speeding up. Graphically, you can see that the slope of these two lines is 0. This slope tells us that the car is not speeding up, or accelerating. We will do more with this information in a later chapter. For now, just remember that the area under the graph and the slope are the two important parts of the graph. Just like we could define a linear equation for the motion in a position vs. time graph, we can also define one for a velocity vs. time graph. As we said, the slope equals the acceleration, a. And in this graph, the y-intercept is v0. Thus, v= v 0 +at .But what if the velocity is not constant? Let’s look back at our jet-car example. At the beginning of the motion, as the car is speeding up, we saw that its position is a curve, as shown in . A graph is shown of the position of a jet-powered car during the time span when it is speeding up. The slope of a d vs. t graph is velocity. This is shown at two points. Instantaneous velocity at any point is the slope of the tangent at that point.You do not have to do this, but you could, theoretically, take the instantaneous velocity at each point on this graph. If you did, you would get , which is just a straight line with a positive slope. The graph shows the velocity of a jet-powered car during the time span when it is speeding up.Again, if we take the slope of the velocity vs. time graph, we get the acceleration, the rate of change of the velocity. And, if we take the area under the slope, we get back to the displacement. Teacher Support Return to the scenario of the drive to and from school. Re-draw the V-shaped position graph. Ask the students what the velocity is at different times on that graph. Students should then be able to see that the corresponding velocity graph is a horizontal line at 0.5km/minute and then a horizontal line at –0.5 km/minute. Then draw a few velocity graphs and see if they can get the corresponding position graph. [OL][AL] Have students describe the relationship between the velocity and the position on these graphs. Ask—Can a velocity graph be used to find the position? Can a velocity graph be used to find anything else? [AL] What is wrong with this graph? Ask students whether the velocity could actually be constant from rest or shift to negative so quickly. What would more realistic graphs look like? How inaccurate is it to ignore the non-constant portion of the motion? [OL] Students should be able to see that if a position graph is a straight line, then the velocity graph will be a horizontal line. Also, the instantaneous velocity can be read off the velocity graph at any moment, but more steps are needed to calculate the average velocity. [AL] Guide students in seeing that the area under the velocity curve is actually the position and the slope represents the rate of change of the velocity, just as the slope of the position line represents the rate of change of the position. Solving Problems using Velocity–Time Graphs Most velocity vs. time graphs will be straight lines. When this is the case, our calculations are fairly simple. Using Velocity Graph to Calculate Some Stuff: Jet Car Use this figure to (a) find the displacement of the jet car over the time shown (b) calculate the rate of change (acceleration) of the velocity. (c) give the instantaneous velocity at 5 s, and (d) calculate the average velocity over the interval shown. Strategy The displacement is given by finding the area under the line in the velocity vs. time graph. The acceleration is given by finding the slope of the velocity graph. The instantaneous velocity can just be read off of the graph. To find the average velocity, recall that v avg = Δd Δt = d f − d 0 t f − t 0 Solution Analyze the shape of the area to be calculated. In this case, the area is made up of a rectangle between 0 and 20 m/s stretching to 30 s. The area of a rectangle is length × width. Therefore, the area of this piece is 600 m. Above that is a triangle whose base is 30 s and height is 140 m/s. The area of a triangle is 0.5 × length × width. The area of this piece, therefore, is 2,100 m. Add them together to get a net displacement of 2,700 m. Take two points on the velocity line. Say, t = 5 s and t = 25 s. At t = 5 s, the value of v = 40 m/s. At t = 25 s, v = 140 m/s. Find the slope. a = Δv Δt = 100 m/s 20 s = 5 m/s 2 The instantaneous velocity at t = 5 s, as we found in part (b) is just 40 m/s. Find the net displacement, which we found in part (a) was 2,700 m. Find the total time which for this case is 30 s. Divide 2,700 m/30 s = 90 m/s. Discussion The average velocity we calculated here makes sense if we look at the graph. 100m/s falls about halfway across the graph and since it is a straight line, we would expect about half the velocity to be above and half below. Teacher Support The quantities solved for are slightly different in the different kinds of graphs, but students should begin to see that the process of analyzing or breaking down any of these graphs is similar. Ask—Where are the turning points in the motion? When is the object moving forward? What does a curve in the graph mean? Also, students should start to have an intuitive understanding of the relationship between position and velocity graphs. You can have negative position, velocity, and acceleration on a graph that describes the way the object is moving. You should never see a graph with negative time on an axis. Why? Most of the velocity vs. time graphs we will look at will be simple to interpret. Occasionally, we will look at curved graphs of velocity vs. time. More often, these curved graphs occur when something is speeding up, often from rest. Let’s look back at a more realistic velocity vs. time graph of the jet car’s motion that takes this speeding up stage into account. The graph shows a more accurate graph of the velocity of a jet-powered car during the time span when it is speeding up.Using Curvy Velocity Graph to Calculate Some Stuff: Jet Car, Take Two Use to (a) find the approximate displacement of the jet car over the time shown, (b) calculate the instantaneous acceleration at t = 30 s, (c) find the instantaneous velocity at 30 s, and (d) calculate the approximate average velocity over the interval shown.Strategy Because this graph is an undefined curve, we have to estimate shapes over smaller intervals in order to find the areas. Like when we were working with a curved displacement graph, we will need to take a tangent line at the instant we are interested and use that to calculate the instantaneous acceleration. The instantaneous velocity can still be read off of the graph. We will find the average velocity the same way we did in the previous example. Solution This problem is more complicated than the last example. To get a good estimate, we should probably break the curve into four sections. 0 → 10 s, 10 → 20 s, 20 → 40 s, and 40 → 70 s. Calculate the bottom rectangle (common to all pieces). 165 m/s × 70 s = 11,550 m. Estimate a triangle at the top, and calculate the area for each section. Section 1 = 225 m; section 2 = 100 m + 450 m = 550 m; section 3 = 150 m + 1,300 m = 1,450 m; section 4 = 2,550 m. Add them together to get a net displacement of 16,325 m. Using the tangent line given, we find that the slope is 1 m/s2. The instantaneous velocity at t = 30 s, is 240 m/s. Find the net displacement, which we found in part (a), was 16,325 m. Find the total time, which for this case is 70 s. Divide 16,325 m 70 s ∼233 m/s Discussion This is a much more complicated process than the first problem. If we were to use these estimates to come up with the average velocity over just the first 30 s we would get about 191 m/s. By approximating that curve with a line, we get an average velocity of 202.5 m/s. Depending on our purposes and how precise an answer we need, sometimes calling a curve a straight line is a worthwhile approximation. Teacher Support Finding the tangent line can be a challenging concept for high school students, and they need to understand it theoretically. If you drew a regular curve inside of the curve at the point you are interested in, you could draw a radius of that curve. The tangent line would be the line perpendicular to that radius. [OL] Have the students compare this problem and the last one. Ask—What is the difference? When would you care about the more accurate picture of the motion? And when would it really not matter? Why would you ever want to look at a less accurate depiction of motion? Practice Problems Consider the velocity vs. time graph shown below of a person in an elevator. Suppose the elevator is initially at rest. It then speeds up for 3 seconds, maintains that velocity for 15 seconds, then slows down for 5 seconds until it stops. Find the instantaneous velocity at t = 10 s and t = 23 s. Instantaneous velocity at t = 10 s and t = 23 s are 0 m/s and 0 m/s. Instantaneous velocity at t = 10 s and t = 23 s are 0 m/s and 3 m/s. Instantaneous velocity at t = 10 s and t = 23 s are 3 m/s and 0 m/s. Instantaneous velocity at t = 10 s and t = 23 s are 3 m/s and 1.5 m/s. Calculate the net displacement and the average velocity of the elevator over the time interval shown. Net displacement is 45 m and average velocity is 2.10 m/s. Net displacement is 45 m and average velocity is 2.28 m/s. Net displacement is 57 m and average velocity is 2.66 m/s. Net displacement is 57 m and average velocity is 2.48 m/s. Graphing Motion, Take Two In this activity, you will graph a moving ball’s velocity vs. time. your graph from the earlier Graphing Motion Snap Lab! 1 piece of graph paper 1 pencil Procedure Take your graph from the earlier Graphing Motion Snap Lab! and use it to create a graph of velocity vs. time. Use your graph to calculate the displacement. Teacher Support In this lab, students will use the displacement graph they drew in the last snap lab to create a velocity graph. If the rolling ball slowed down in the last snap lab, perhaps due to the ramp being too low, then the graph may not show constant velocity.

If students are struggling with a specific objective, the Check Your Understanding will help direct students to the relevant content. Section Summary The slope of a velocity vs. time graph is the acceleration. The area under a velocity vs. time curve is the displacement. Average velocity can be found in a velocity vs. time graph by taking the weighted average of all the velocities. Key Equations Velocity v= v 0 +at Acceleration a= Δv Δt Concept Items A graph of velocity vs. time of a ship coming into a harbor is shown. Describe the acceleration of the ship based on the graph. The ship is moving in the forward direction at a steady rate. Then it accelerates in the forward direction and then decelerates. The ship is moving in the forward direction at a steady rate. Then it turns around and starts decelerating, while traveling in the reverse direction. It then accelerates, but slowly. The ship is moving in the forward direction at a steady rate. Then it decelerates in the forward direction, and then continues to slow down in the forward direction, but with more deceleration. The ship is moving in the forward direction at a steady rate. Then it decelerates in the forward direction, and then continues to slow down in the forward direction, but with less deceleration. Critical Thinking Identify the time, or times, at which the instantaneous velocity is greatest, and the time, or times, at which it is negative. A sketch of velocity vs. time derived from the figure will aid in arriving at the correct answers. The instantaneous velocity is greatest at f, and it is negative at d, h, I, j, and k. The instantaneous velocity is greatest at e, and it is negative at a, b, and f. The instantaneous velocity is greatest at f, and it is negative at d, h, I, j, and k The instantaneous velocity is greatest at d, and it is negative at a, b, and f. Problems You are characterizing the motion of an object by measuring the location of the object at discrete moments in time. What is the minimum number of data points you would need to estimate the average acceleration of the object? 1 2 3 4 The correct answer is (c). A single point tells you only the object’s location at a particular time. Two points allow calculation of the average speed during that time interval, but do not provide information about the acceleration. Three data points are sufficient to provide information on the average acceleration, since they allow determination of average velocities for two different intervals in time. Which option best describes the average acceleration from 40 to 70 s? It is negative and smaller in magnitude than the initial acceleration. It is negative and larger in magnitude than the initial acceleration. It is positive and smaller in magnitude than the initial acceleration. It is positive and larger in magnitude than the initial acceleration. The graph shows velocity vs. time. Calculate the net displacement using seven different divisions. Calculate it again using two divisions: 0 → 40 s and 40 → 70 s . Compare. Using both, calculate the average velocity. Displacement and average velocity using seven divisions are 14,312.5 m and 204.5 m/s while with two divisions are 15,500 m and 221.4 m/s respectively.

Performance TaskThe National Mall in Washington, DC, is a national park containing most of the highly treasured memorials and museums of the United States. However, the National Mall also hosts many events and concerts. The map below shows the area for a benefit concert during which the president will speak. The concert stage is near the Lincoln Memorial. The seats and standing room for the crowd will stretch from the stage east to near the Washington Monument, as shown on the map. You are planning the logistics for the concert. Use the map scale to measure any distances needed to make the calculations below. The park has three new long-distance speakers. They would like to use these speakers to broadcast the concert audio to other parts of the National Mall. The speakers can project sound up to 0.35 miles away but they must be connected to one of the power supplies within the concert area. What is the minimum amount of wire needed for each speaker, in miles, in order to project the audio to the following areas? Assume that wire cannot be placed over buildings or any memorials.Part A. The center of the Jefferson Memorial using power supply 1 (This will involve an elevated wire that can travel over water.)Part B. The center of the Ellipse using power supply 3 (This wire cannot travel over water.)Part C. The president’s motorcade will be traveling to the concert from the White House. To avoid concert traffic, the motorcade travels from the White House west down E Street and then turns south on 23rd Street to reach the Lincoln memorial. What minimum speed, in miles per hour to the nearest tenth, would the motorcade have to travel to make the trip in 5 minutes?Part D. The president could also simply fly from the White House to the Lincoln Memorial using the presidential helicopter, Marine 1. How long would it take Marine 1, traveling slowly at 30 mph, to travel from directly above the White House landing zone (LZ) to directly above the Lincoln Memorial LZ? Disregard liftoff and landing times and report the travel time in minutes to the nearest minute.

Dispel any misconceptions such as, acceleration means very high speed or going faster. Emphasize that acceleration does not just indicate speeding up; acceleration also includes slowing down or changing direction. Explain that acceleration is the change in either the magnitude or direction of velocity, or both. Have students list the objects in the opening image that are moving. Then ask which are definitely accelerating and which might be accelerating. Review the use of + and − signs as they relate to acceleration and velocity. Explain that, when studying motion, these symbols are often used to indicate the direction of motion. The + symbol typically represents motion that is to the right or upward, whereas − typically represents motion that is to the left or downward.You may have heard the term accelerator, referring to the gas pedal in a car. When the gas pedal is pushed down, the flow of gasoline to the engine increases, which increases the car’s velocity. Pushing on the gas pedal results in acceleration because the velocity of the car increases, and acceleration is defined as a change in velocity. You need two quantities to define velocity: a speed and a direction. Changing either of these quantities, or both together, changes the velocity. You may be surprised to learn that pushing on the brake pedal or turning the steering wheel also causes acceleration. The first reduces the speed and so changes the velocity, and the second changes the direction and also changes the velocity.In fact, any change in velocity—whether positive, negative, directional, or any combination of these—is called an acceleration in physics. The plane in the picture is said to be accelerating because its velocity is decreasing as it prepares to land. To begin our study of acceleration, we need to have a clear understanding of what acceleration means.Teacher Support Before students begin this chapter, it is useful to review the following concepts: Significant figures—demonstrate how to obtain the proper number of significant figures when adding and multiplying Scientific notation and how it expresses significant figures Converting units—demonstrate how to convert from km/h to m/s; show how units cancel in calculations Calculating average—demonstrate how to calculate the average of two numbers Commonly used terms—explain that constant means unchanging, so constant acceleration refers to acceleration that is not changing in time Explain that initial means starting or beginning, so the initial time is the time at which the action of interest begins Explain that an object that is not moving is often described in physics as being at rest Review conventions of coordinate systems Review kinematics concepts introduced earlier: vectors, displacement, velocity, and speed", "formulas": [], "subsections": [{"id": "m54119", "content": "Introduction m54119 Introduction b7cf549d-737c-4b6f-81bb-bcae2dff6668 A plane slows down as it comes in for landing in St. Maarten.

Section Key Terms average acceleration instantaneous acceleration negative acceleration Teacher Support [BL][OL] Begin a general discussion about acceleration and deceleration. Ask for examples of both. Explain that deceleration is not used in physics because acceleration is either positive or negative. Lead students to their topics of interest, such as motor vehicles or sports. Explain that the capital Greek letter delta always means final minus initial and that the net change may be zero, positive, or negative. [AL] See how much students remember about vectors. What does a vector arrow represent? Ask them to name some quantities that are vectors and some that are scalars. Defining AccelerationThroughout this chapter we will use the following terms: time, displacement, velocity, and acceleration. Recall that each of these terms has a designated variable and SI unit of measurement as follows: Time: t, measured in seconds (s) Displacement: Δd, measured in meters (m) Velocity: v, measured in meters per second (m/s) Acceleration: a, measured in meters per second per second (m/s2, also called meters per second squared) Also note the following: Δ means change in The subscript 0 refers to an initial value; sometimes subscript i is instead used to refer to initial value. The subscript f refers to final value A bar over a symbol, such as a ¯, means average Teacher Support [BL] Review definitions of the terms: time, displacement, velocity, and acceleration. Point out that the variables commonly used to represent these quantities are the first letters of the corresponding term. [OL] Verify that the students know the SI units in which time, displacement, velocity, and acceleration are expressed. Note that these are some of the seven base units of the metric system. Explain that converting to base units is a good first step when calculating these quantities. Explain the meaning of seconds squared in the denominator of the units of acceleration. [AL] Review all the base units of the metric system. Explain how these units are interrelated. For example, show how length is defined by time. [BL][OL] Use the equation a ¯ = Δv Δt = v f − v 0 t f − t 0 to emphasize the relationship between Δ and the subscripts f and 0. Distinguish between constant and variable acceleration. There could be confusion here, especially in the case of increasing acceleration. Be sure students understand that the word deceleration is not used in physics and that acceleration may be either positive or negative.[AL] See if students can use the concept of acceleration to understand confusing statements such as “a decrease in the rate of increase.” For example, use the concept of acceleration to analyze the statement “the rate of increase in the cost of health care is decreasing.” If the increase in the cost is defined as positive, then the acceleration in the cost of health care would be negative. [OL] The arrow for acceleration that points opposite to the arrow for velocity may be confusing. Explain that the acceleration arrow points in the direction opposite the velocity because the velocity is getting smaller, i.e., the velocity arrow is getting shorter. Acceleration is the change in velocity divided by a period of time during which the change occurs. The SI units of velocity are m/s and the SI units for time are s, so the SI units for acceleration are m/s2. Average acceleration is given by a ¯ = Δv Δt = v f − v 0 t f − t 0 . Average acceleration is distinguished from instantaneous acceleration, which is acceleration at a specific instant in time. The magnitude of acceleration is often not constant over time. For example, runners in a race accelerate at a greater rate in the first second of a race than during the following seconds. You do not need to know all the instantaneous accelerations at all times to calculate average acceleration. All you need to know is the change in velocity (i.e., the final velocity minus the initial velocity) and the change in time (i.e., the final time minus the initial time), as shown in the formula. A component of the average acceleration can be positive, negative, or zero. A negative acceleration component is simply an acceleration in the negative direction along that axis. When the motion is in one dimension, we often simply refer to this as negative acceleration, and acceleration in the positive direction as positive acceleration. Keep in mind that although acceleration points in the same direction as the change in velocity, it is not always in the direction of the velocity itself. When an object slows down, its acceleration is opposite to the direction of its velocity. In everyday language, this is called deceleration; but in physics, it is acceleration—whose direction happens to be opposite that of the velocity. For now, let us assume that motion to the right along the x-axis is positive and motion to the left is negative. shows a car with positive acceleration in (a) and negative acceleration in (b). The arrows represent vectors showing both direction and magnitude of velocity and acceleration. The car is speeding up in (a) and slowing down in (b). Velocity and acceleration are both vector quantities. Recall that vectors have both magnitude and direction. An object traveling at a constant speed does accelerate if it changes direction. So, turning the steering wheel of a moving car makes the car accelerate because the velocity changes direction. The Moving ManWith this animation, you can produce both variations of acceleration and velocity shown in , plus a few more variations. Vary the velocity and acceleration by sliding the red and green markers along the scales. Keeping the velocity marker near zero will make the effect of acceleration more obvious. Try changing acceleration from positive to negative while the man is moving. We will come back to this animation and look at the Charts view when we study graphical representation of motion. Teacher Support Have students use a very low setting for velocity and acceleration because it is easier to see how the motion changes. Show students how setting velocity as positive and acceleration as negative creates the motion that resembles that of an object thrown into the air. Which part, (a) or (b), is represented when the velocity vector is on the positive side of the scale and the acceleration vector is set on the negative side of the scale? What does the cars motion look like for the given scenario? Part (a). The car is slowing down because the acceleration and the velocity vectors are acting in the opposite direction. Part (a). The car is speeding up because the acceleration and the velocity vectors are acting in the same direction. Part (b). The car is slowing down because the acceleration and velocity vectors are acting in the opposite directions. Part (b). The car is speeding up because the acceleration and the velocity vectors are acting in the same direction. Calculating Average Acceleration Look back at the equation for average acceleration. You can see that the calculation of average acceleration involves three values: change in time, (Δt); change in velocity, (Δv); and acceleration (a). Change in time is often stated as a time interval, and change in velocity can often be calculated by subtracting the initial velocity from the final velocity. Average acceleration is then simply change in velocity divided by change in time. Before you begin calculating, be sure that all distances and times have been converted to meters and seconds. Look at these examples of acceleration of a subway train. Recall that for analysis of motion in only one dimension, we do not need to use vectors. Instead, we can treat displacement, velocity, and acceleration as scalars. Unlike magnitudes, scalars can be positive or negative, so the sign can serve to tell us the direction along the one-dimensional axis. Teacher Support [BL][OL] Before beginning the calculations, verify that students understand the equation for acceleration. Do they understand what it means when quantities have a plus or minus sign? Do they understand the units for each variable? An Accelerating Subway Train A subway train accelerates from rest to 30.0 km/h in 20.0 s. What is the average acceleration during that time interval? Strategy Start by making a simple sketch. This problem involves four steps: Convert to units of meters and seconds. Determine the change in velocity. Determine the change in time. Use these values to calculate the average acceleration. Solution Identify the knowns. Be sure to read the problem for given information, which may not look like numbers. When the problem states that the train starts from rest, you can write down that the initial velocity is 0 m/s. Therefore, v0 = 0; vf = 30.0 km/h; and Δt = 20.0 s. Convert the units. 30.0 km h × 10 3 m 1 km × 1 h 3600 s = 8.333 m s Calculate change in velocity, Δv= v f – v 0 = 8.333 m/s – 0 = + 8.333 m/s, where the plus sign means the change in velocity is to the right. We know Δt, so all we have to do is insert the known values into the formula for average acceleration. a ¯ = Δv Δt = 8.333m/s 20.00s =+0.417 m s 2 Discussion The plus sign in the answer means that acceleration is to the right. This is a reasonable conclusion because the train starts from rest and ends up with a velocity directed to the right (i.e., positive). So, acceleration is in the same direction as the change in velocity, as it should be. Teacher Support Note that extra digits were carried along and rounding off to the correct number of significant figures, 3, was not done until the final answer was calculated. An Accelerating Subway Train Now, suppose that at the end of its trip, the train slows to a stop in 8.00 s from a speed of 30.0 km/h. What is its average acceleration during this time? Strategy Again, make a simple sketch. In this case, the train is decelerating and its acceleration is negative because it is pointing to the left. As in the previous example, we must find the change in velocity and change in time, then solve for acceleration. Solution Identify the knowns: v0 = 30.0 km/h; vf = 0; and Δt = 8.00 s. Convert the units. From the first problem, we know that 30.0 km/h = 8.333 m/s. Calculate change in velocity, Δv= v f − v 0 =0−8.333m/s=−8.333m/s, where the minus sign means that the change in velocity points to the left. We know Δt = 8.00 s, so all we have to do is insert the known values into the equation for average acceleration. a ¯ = Δv Δt = −8.333m/s 8.00s =−1.04 m s 2 Discussion The minus sign indicates that acceleration is to the left. This is reasonable because the train initially has a positive velocity in this problem, and a negative acceleration would reduce the velocity. Again, acceleration is in the same direction as the change in velocity, which is negative in this case. This acceleration can be called a deceleration because it has a direction opposite to the velocity. Teacher Support Help students see the relationship between the direction of the vector arrows and the plus and minus signs. Explain that one indication of the sign for acceleration is that it is in the direction opposite that of the velocity. Also point out that correctly identifying the initial and final speeds will result in the correct sign for acceleration. It is easier to get plus and minus signs correct if you always assume that motion is away from zero and toward positive values on the x-axis. This way v always starts off being positive and points to the right. If speed is increasing, then acceleration is positive and also points to the right. If speed is decreasing, then acceleration is negative and points to the left. It is a good idea to carry two extra significant figures from step-to-step when making calculations. Do not round off with each step. When you arrive at the final answer, apply the rules of significant figures for the operations you carried out and round to the correct number of digits. Sometimes this will make your answer slightly more accurate. Practice Problems Acceleration This video shows the basic calculation of acceleration and some useful unit conversions. Teacher Support Ask students to note the explanation of units and the identification of the vector quantities. Tell them the calculations demonstrated in the video are fairly straightforward and that the definitions given for displacement, elapsed time, velocity, and acceleration should be clear. Measure the Acceleration of a Bicycle on a Slope In this lab you will take measurements to determine if the acceleration of a moving bicycle is constant. If the acceleration is constant, then the following relationships hold: v ¯ = Δd Δt = v 0 + v f 2 If v 0 =0 , then v f =2 v ¯ and a ¯ = v f Δt You will work in pairs to measure and record data for a bicycle coasting down an incline on a smooth, gentle slope. The data will consist of distances traveled and elapsed times. Find an open area to minimize the risk of injury during this lab. stopwatch measuring tape bicycle Find a gentle, paved slope, such as an incline on a bike path. The more gentle the slope, the more accurate your data will likely be. Mark uniform distances along the slope, such as 5 m, 10 m, etc. Determine the following roles: the bike rider, the timer, and the recorder. The recorder should create a data table to collect the distance and time data. Have the rider at the starting point at rest on the bike. When the timer calls Start, the timer starts the stopwatch and the rider begins coasting down the slope on the bike without pedaling. Have the timer call out the elapsed times as the bike passes each marked point. The recorder should record the times in the data table. It may be necessary to repeat the process to practice roles and make necessary adjustments. Once acceptable data has been recorded, switch roles. Repeat Steps 3–5 to collect a second set of data. Switch roles again to collect a third set of data. Calculate average acceleration for each set of distance-time data. If your result for a¯ is not the same for different pairs of Δv and Δt, then acceleration is not constant. Interpret your results. Teacher Support Explain that two factors that could prevent uniform acceleration are (i) friction between the tires and the pavement and friction in the bicycle axles, and (ii) air resistance. Discuss methods for minimizing these factors—e.g., selecting a smoother surface for the bike to coast, greasing the axles, etc. Explain that friction will only decrease acceleration, but air resistance to a tail wind would increase acceleration. Discuss why it would be difficult to study constant acceleration if students were to pedal the bicycle. Note that the given kinematic equation that is valid for constant acceleration, which is presented at the start of the Snap Lab, will be presented in further detail in the following section. Prior to the lab, investigate appropriate areas around the school that have gentle, uniform slopes. Should the number of bicycles be limited, consider conducting the lab as a whole class or in larger clusters. Ensure that the planned paths of student groups do not cross and that there is adequate space for riders to stop without risk of injury. If you graph the average velocity (y-axis) vs. the elapsed time (x-axis), what would the graph look like if acceleration is uniform? a horizontal line on the graph a diagonal line on the graph an upward-facing parabola on the graph a downward-facing parabola on the graph Check Your UnderstandingTeacher Support Use these questions to assess student achievement of the section’s Learning Objectives.

Section Summary Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. Its magnitude is expressed in units of m/s2. The components of acceleration may be positive or negative.

Section Key Terms acceleration due to gravity kinematic equations uniform acceleration Teacher Support [BL] Briefly review displacement, time, velocity, and acceleration; their variables, and their units. [OL][AL] Explain that this section introduces five equations that allow us to solve a wider range of problems than just finding acceleration from time and velocity. Review graphical analysis, including axes, algebraic signs, how to designate points on a coordinate plane, i.e., (x, y), slopes, and intercepts. Explain that these equations can also be represented graphically. How the Kinematic Equations are Related to AccelerationWe are studying concepts related to motion: time, displacement, velocity, and especially acceleration. We are only concerned with motion in one dimension. The kinematic equations that we will be using apply to conditions of constant acceleration, except where noted, and show how these concepts are related. Constant acceleration is acceleration that does not change over time. The first kinematic equation relates displacement d, average velocity v ¯ , and time t. d=d0 + v¯t The initial displacement d0 is often 0, in which case the equation can be written as v ¯ = d t This equation, which is the definition of average velocity and valid for both constant and non-constant acceleration, says that average velocity is displacement per unit time. We will express velocity in meters per second. If we graph displacement versus time, as in , the slope will be the velocity. Whenever a rate, such as velocity, is represented graphically, time is usually taken to be the independent variable and is plotted along the x axis. The slope of displacement versus time is velocity. The second kinematic equation, another expression for average velocity v ¯ , is simply the initial velocity plus the final velocity divided by two. This equation is only valid for constant acceleration. v ¯ = v 0 + v f 2 Now we come to our main focus of this chapter; namely, the kinematic equations that describe motion with constant acceleration. In the third kinematic equation, acceleration is the rate at which velocity increases, so velocity at any point equals initial velocity plus acceleration multiplied by time v= v0+at Also, if we start from rest (v 0=0), we can write a=v t Note that this third kinematic equation does not have displacement in it. Therefore, if you do not know the displacement and are not trying to solve for a displacement, this equation might be a good one to use.The third kinematic equation is also represented by the graph in . The slope of velocity versus time is acceleration. The fourth kinematic equation shows how displacement is related to acceleration d= d 0 + v 0 t+ 1 2 a t 2 . When starting at the origin, d0=0 and, when starting from rest, v0=0 , in which case the equation can be written as a= 2d t 2 . This equation tells us that, for constant acceleration, the slope of a plot of 2d versus t2 is acceleration, as shown in . When acceleration is constant, the slope of 2d versus t2 gives the acceleration. The fifth kinematic equation relates velocity, acceleration, and displacement v 2 = v 0 2 +2a( d− d 0 ) . This equation is useful for when we do not know, or do not need to know, the time. When starting from rest, the fifth equation simplifies to a= v 2 2d . According to this equation, a graph of velocity squared versus twice the displacement will have a slope equal to acceleration. Note that, in reality, knowns and unknowns will vary. Sometimes you will want to rearrange a kinematic equation so that the knowns are the values on the axes and the unknown is the slope. Sometimes the intercept will not be at the origin (0,0). This will happen when v0 or d0 is not zero. This will be the case when the object of interest is already in motion, or the motion begins at some point other than at the origin of the coordinate system. Teacher Support [BL] Be sure everyone is completely comfortable with the idea that velocity is displacement divided by the time during which the displacement occurs. Use everyday examples. [OL] Remind students that they studied velocity in earlier chapters. Relate the simplified equation v ¯ = d t to a graph of displacement versus time. Point out that the plot starts at (0,0) because the initial velocity is zero. Pick a segment on the graph and explain how to find the slope at this segment. Explain that would show a straight line if velocity were changing; that is, if the object were accelerating. Show how the graph would change for both negative and positive acceleration. [OL] Build on the understanding of velocity to introduce acceleration. Contrast constant velocity with changing velocity. Use everyday examples from transportation, sports, or amusement park rides. Explain that represents constant acceleration because it is a straight line. Give examples of increasing, decreasing, and constant acceleration, and explain how each affects the shape of plots of velocity versus time. [OL][AL] Ask students why all three of the plots are straight lines. Refer to the graph of 2d vs t2 and explain why this is a straight line, whereas d vs t would be nonlinear. The Moving Man (Part 2) Look at the Moving Man simulation again and this time use the Charts view. Again, vary the velocity and acceleration by sliding the red and green markers along the scales. Keeping the velocity marker near zero will make the effect of acceleration more obvious. Observe how the graphs of position, velocity, and acceleration vary with time. Note which are linear plots and which are not. Teacher Support Ask the students to click the Charts option and adjust the settings for the animation to reproduce the plots found in and . On a velocity versus time plot, what does the slope represent? Acceleration Displacement Distance covered Instantaneous velocity On a position versus time plot, what does the slope represent? Acceleration Displacement Distance covered Instantaneous velocity The kinematic equations are applicable when you have constant acceleration. d= d 0 + v ¯ t , or v ¯ = d t when d0 = 0 v ¯ = v 0 + v f 2 v= v 0 +at , or a= v t when v0 = 0 d= d 0 + v 0 t+ 1 2 a t 2 , or a= 2d t 2 when d0 = 0 and v0 = 0 v 2 = v 0 2 +2a( d− d 0 ) , or a= v 2 2d when d0 = 0 and v0 = 0 Teacher Support [OL] Go through the algebra to show how the kinematic equations can be simplified when some of the values are zero. Note that any motion starting or ending in a motionless state will simplify the equations. Applying Kinematic Equations to Situations of Constant Acceleration Problem-solving skills are essential to success in a science and life in general. The ability to apply broad physical principles, which are often represented by equations, to specific situations is a very powerful form of knowledge. It is much more powerful than memorizing a list of facts. Analytical skills and problem-solving abilities can be applied to new situations, whereas a list of facts cannot be made long enough to contain every possible circumstance. Essential analytical skills will be developed by solving problems in this text and will be useful for understanding physics and science in general throughout your life. Problem-Solving Steps While no single step-by-step method works for every problem, the following general procedures facilitate problem solving and make the answers more meaningful. A certain amount of creativity and insight are required as well. Examine the situation to determine which physical principles are involved. It is vital to draw a simple sketch at the outset. Decide which direction is positive and note that on your sketch. Identify the knowns: Make a list of what information is given or can be inferred from the problem statement. Remember, not all given information will be in the form of a number with units in the problem. If something starts from rest, we know the initial velocity is zero. If something stops, we know the final velocity is zero. Identify the unknowns: Decide exactly what needs to be determined in the problem. Find an equation or set of equations that can help you solve the problem. Your list of knowns and unknowns can help here. For example, if time is not needed or not given, then the fifth kinematic equation, which does not include time, could be useful. Insert the knowns along with their units into the appropriate equation and obtain numerical solutions complete with units. This step produces the numerical answer; it also provides a check on units that can help you find errors. If the units of the answer are incorrect, then an error has been made. Check the answer to see if it is reasonable: Does it make sense? This final step is extremely important because the goal of physics is to accurately describe nature. To see if the answer is reasonable, check its magnitude, its sign, and its units. Are the significant figures correct? Summary of Problem Solving Determine the knowns and unknowns. Find an equation that expresses the unknown in terms of the knowns. More than one unknown means more than one equation is needed. Solve the equation or equations. Be sure units and significant figures are correct. Check whether the answer is reasonable. Teacher Support [BL][OL][AL] Consider starting with the simplified summary of problem solving and then expand it to the more wordy description above. Stress that this is not a strict recipe that can solve all problems. Applying analytical skills is still required. If the preliminary analysis is correct and the knowns and unknowns are correctly sorted, the rest should be correct. Try applying the method to some non-mathematical everyday problems. Ask for suggestions. Drag Racing Smoke rises from the tires of a dragster at the beginning of a drag race. (Lt. Col. William Thurmond. Photo courtesy of U.S. Army.)The object of the sport of drag racing is acceleration. Period! The races take place from a standing start on a straight one-quarter-mile (402 m) track. Usually two cars race side by side, and the winner is the driver who gets the car past the quarter-mile point first. At the finish line, the cars may be going more than 300 miles per hour (134 m/s). The driver then deploys a parachute to bring the car to a stop because it is unsafe to brake at such high speeds. The cars, called dragsters, are capable of accelerating at 26 m/s2. By comparison, a typical sports car that is available to the general public can accelerate at about 5 m/s2. Several measurements are taken during each drag race: Reaction time is the time between the starting signal and when the front of the car crosses the starting line. Elapsed time is the time from when the vehicle crosses the starting line to when it crosses the finish line. The record is a little over 3 s. Speed is the average speed during the last 20 m before the finish line. The record is a little under 400 mph. The video shows a race between two dragsters powered by jet engines. The actual race lasts about four seconds and is near the end of the video. Teacher Support Explain the direction and magnitude of acceleration and velocity vectors before and after the braking chute is deployed. Explain that ¼ mile is 440 yards. If any students are on the track team, you might ask them to describe this distance. Compare record times for this track event to 4 seconds. Acceleration of a Dragster The time it takes for a dragster to cross the finish line is unknown. The dragster accelerates from rest at 26 m/s2 for a quarter mile (0.250 mi). What is the final velocity of the dragster? Strategy The equation v 2 = v 0 2 +2a( d− d 0 ) is ideally suited to this task because it gives the velocity from acceleration and displacement, without involving the time. Solution Convert miles to meters. (0.250 mi)× 1609 m 1 mi =402 m Identify the known values. We know that v0 = 0 since the dragster starts from rest, and we know that the distance traveled, d − d0 is 402 m. Finally, the acceleration is constant at a = 26.0 m/s2. Insert the knowns into the equation v 2 = v 0 2 +2a( d− d 0 ) and solve for v. v 2 =0+2( 26.0 m s 2 )(402 m)=2.09× 10 4 m 2 s 2 Taking the square root gives us v= 2.09× 10 4 m 2 s 2 =145 m s . Discussion 145 m/s is about 522 km/hour or about 324 mi/h, but even this breakneck speed is short of the record for the quarter mile. Also, note that a square root has two values. We took the positive value because we know that the velocity must be in the same direction as the acceleration for the answer to make physical sense. An examination of the equation v 2 = v 0 2 +2a( d− d 0 ) can produce further insights into the general relationships among physical quantities: The final velocity depends on the magnitude of the acceleration and the distance over which it applies. For a given acceleration, a car that is going twice as fast does not stop in twice the distance—it goes much further before it stops. This is why, for example, we have reduced speed zones near schools. Teacher Support [OL] Work through the problem-solving steps with the student. What is the goal? What is known and unknown? Which equation expresses the unknown in terms of the knowns? Solve for the unknown. Insert known values. Calculate. Checking that answer is reasonable and has the correct units, sign, and significant figures. Repeat for the second sample problem. [AL] Initiate a discussion on variation in gravity. Compare gravity on Earth to gravity on the moon. Explain the difference between g and constants that are the same everywhere in the universe, such as the speed of light. Practice Problems Dragsters can reach a top speed of 145 m/s in only 4.45 s. Calculate the average acceleration for such a dragster. −32.6 m/s2 0 m/s2 32.6 m/s2 145 m/s2 An Olympic-class sprinter starts a race with an acceleration of 4.50 m/s2. Assuming she can maintain that acceleration, what is her speed 2.40 s later? 4.50 m/s 10.8 m/s 19.6 m/s 44.1 m/s Constant Acceleration In many cases, acceleration is not uniform because the force acting on the accelerating object is not constant over time. A situation that gives constant acceleration is the acceleration of falling objects. When air resistance is not a factor, all objects near Earth’s surface fall with an acceleration of about 9.80 m/s2. Although this value decreases slightly with increasing altitude, it may be assumed to be essentially constant. The value of 9.80 m/s2 is labeled g and is referred to as acceleration due to gravity. Gravity is the force that causes nonsupported objects to accelerate downward—or, more precisely, toward the center of Earth. The magnitude of this force is called the weight of the object and is given by mg where m is the mass of the object (in kg). In places other than on Earth, such as the Moon or on other planets, g is not 9.80 m/s2, but takes on other values. When using g for the acceleration a in a kinematic equation, it is usually given a negative sign because the acceleration due to gravity is downward.Effects of Rapid Acceleration Astronauts train using G Force Simulators. (NASA) When in a vehicle that accelerates rapidly, you experience a force on your entire body that accelerates your body. You feel this force in automobiles and slightly more on amusement park rides. For example, when you ride in a car that turns, the car applies a force on your body to make you accelerate in the direction in which the car is turning. If enough force is applied, you will accelerate at 9.80 m/s2. This is the same as the acceleration due to gravity, so this force is called one G.One G is the force required to accelerate an object at the acceleration due to gravity at Earth’s surface. Thus, one G for a paper cup is much less than one G for an elephant, because the elephant is much more massive and requires a greater force to make it accelerate at 9.80 m/s2. For a person, a G of about 4 is so strong that his or her face will distort as the bones accelerate forward through the loose flesh. Other symptoms at extremely high Gs include changes in vision, loss of consciousness, and even death. The space shuttle produces about 3 Gs during takeoff and reentry. Some roller coasters and dragsters produce forces of around 4 Gs for their occupants. A fighter jet can produce up to 12 Gs during a sharp turn. Astronauts and fighter pilots must undergo G-force training in simulators. The video shows the experience of several people undergoing this training.People, such as astronauts, who work with G forces must also be trained to experience zero G—also called free fall or weightlessness—which can cause queasiness. NASA has an aircraft that allows it occupants to experience about 25 s of free fall. The aircraft is nicknamed the Vomit Comet. Teacher Support Mention that, later in this course, students will encounter some interesting concepts related to gravity and acceleration when studying the general theory of relativity. In part, the theory is based on the idea that gravity cannot be distinguished from acceleration, either experientially or mathematically. When in an upward-bound elevator, can you really tell whether you are accelerating or whether gravity has suddenly become stronger? A common way to describe acceleration is to express it in multiples of g, Earth's gravitational acceleration. If a dragster accelerates at a rate of 39.2 m/s2, how many g's does the driver experience? 1.5 g 4.0 g 10.5 g 24.5 g Falling Objects A person standing on the edge of a high cliff throws a rock straight up with an initial velocity v0 of 13 m/s. (a) Calculate the position and velocity of the rock at 1.00, 2.00, and 3.00 seconds after it is thrown. Ignore the effect of air resistance. Strategy Sketch the initial velocity and acceleration vectors and the axes. Initial conditions for rock thrown straight up. List the knowns: time t = 1.00 s, 2.00 s, and 3.00 s; initial velocity v0 = 13 m/s; acceleration a = g = –9.80 m/s2; and position y0 = 0 m List the unknowns: y1, y2, and y3; v1, v2, and v3—where 1, 2, 3 refer to times 1.00 s, 2.00 s, and 3.00 s Choose the equations. d= d 0 + v 0 t+ 1 2 a t 2 becomesy= y 0 + v 0 t− 1 2 g t 2 v= v 0 +at becomes v= v 0 +−gt These equations describe the unknowns in terms of knowns only. Solution y 1 =0+( 13.0m/s )( 1.00s )+ ( −9.80 m/s 2 ) ( 1.00s ) 2 2 =8.10m y 2 =0+( 13.0m/s )( 2.00s )+ ( −9.80 m/s 2 ) ( 2.00s ) 2 2 =6.40m y 3 =0+( 13.0m/s )( 3.00s )+ ( −9.80 m/s 2 ) ( 3.00s ) 2 2 =−5.10m v 1 =13.0m/s+( −9.80 m/s 2 )( 1.00s )=3.20m/s v 2 =13.0m/s+( −9.80 m/s 2 )( 2.00s )=−6.60m/s v 3 =13.0m/s+( −9.80 m/s 2 )( 3.00s )=−16.4m/s Discussion The first two positive values for y show that the rock is still above the edge of the cliff, and the third negative y value shows that it has passed the starting point and is below the cliff. Remember that we set up to be positive. Any position with a positive value is above the cliff, and any velocity with a positive value is an upward velocity. The first value for v is positive, so the rock is still on the way up. The second and third values for v are negative, so the rock is on its way down. (b) Make graphs of position versus time, velocity versus time, and acceleration versus time. Use increments of 0.5 s in your graphs. Strategy Time is customarily plotted on the x-axis because it is the independent variable. Position versus time will not be linear, so calculate points for 0.50 s, 1.50 s, and 2.50 s. This will give a curve closer to the true, smooth shape. Solution The three graphs are shown in . Discussion y vs. t does not represent the two-dimensional parabolic path of a trajectory. The path of the rock is straight up and straight down. The slope of a line tangent to the curve at any point on the curve equals the velocity at that point—i.e., the instantaneous velocity. Note that the v vs. t line crosses the vertical axis at the initial velocity and crosses the horizontal axis at the time when the rock changes direction and begins to fall back to Earth. This plot is linear because acceleration is constant. The a vs. t plot also shows that acceleration is constant; that is, it does not change with time. Teacher Support Prior to solving the problem, have students consider the following questions: What is the goal? What is known and unknown? Which equation expresses the unknown in terms of the knowns? After solving the problem, have students check that the answer is reasonable and has the correct units, sign, and significant figures.

Displacement, Force, Mass, and Time Acceleration, Displacement, Time, and Velocity Final Velocity, Force, Initial Velocity, and Mass Acceleration, Final Velocity, Force, and Initial Velocity Section Summary The kinematic equations show how time, displacement, velocity, and acceleration are related for objects in motion. In general, kinematic problems can be solved by identifying the kinematic equation that expresses the unknown in terms of the knowns. Displacement, velocity, and acceleration may be displayed graphically versus time. The kinematic equations in this section are valid only for constant acceleration.

Explain that an object that is not moving is often described in physics as being at rest. Teacher Support Point out that we come across motion in our everyday lives; for instance, a dolphin jumping out of water as shown in the photo. There are simple laws of physics that govern motion. These laws are universal; that is, they apply to every object in the universe. Much of the work done in describing motion was done by Sir Isaac Newton. This chapter is about motion, the causes of motion, and the universal laws of motion. Isaac Newton (1642–1727) was a natural philosopher; a great thinker who combined science and philosophy to try to explain the workings of nature on Earth and in the universe. His laws of motion were just one part of the monumental work that has made him legendary. The development of Newton’s laws marks the transition from the Renaissance period of history to the modern era. This transition was characterized by a revolutionary change in the way people thought about the physical universe. Drawing upon earlier work by scientists Galileo Galilei and Johannes Kepler, Newton’s laws of motion allowed motion on Earth and in space to be predicted mathematically.

The student knows and applies the laws governing motion in a variety of situations. The student is expected to: (C) analyze and describe accelerated motion in two dimensions using equations, including projectile and circular examples; (E) develop and interpret free-body diagrams. [BL][OL] Point out that objects at rest tend to stay at rest. A ball, for example, moves only when pushed or pulled. The action of pushing or pulling is the application of force. Force applied to an object changes its motion. [AL] Start a discussion about force and motion. Ask students what would happen if more than one force is applied to an object. Take a heavy object such as a desk for demonstration. Ask one student to push it from one side. Explain how force and motion work. Now ask a second student to push it in the opposite direction. Ask students why no motion occurs, even though the first student applies the same amount of force. Introduce the concept of adding forces. Section Key Terms dynamics external force force free-body diagram net external force net force Defining Force and Dynamics Teacher Support [OL] Explain that the word dynamics comes from a Greek word meaning power. Also point out that the word dynamics is singular, like the word physics.[BL][OL] You may want to introduce the terms system, external force, and internal force. [AL] Explain that both magnitude and direction must be considered when talking about forces. By using physical objects, demonstrate how different forces acting together can be additive if they act in the same direction or cancel one another if they act in opposite directions. Explain the terms acting on and being acted on. Force is the cause of motion, and motion draws our attention. Motion itself can be beautiful, such as a dolphin jumping out of the water, the flight of a bird, or the orbit of a satellite. The study of motion is called kinematics, but kinematics describes only the way objects move—their velocity and their acceleration. Dynamics considers the forces that affect the motion of moving objects and systems. Newton’s laws of motion are the foundation of dynamics. These laws describe the way objects speed up, slow down, stay in motion, and interact with other objects. They are also universal laws: they apply everywhere on Earth as well as in space.A force pushes or pulls an object. The object being moved by a force could be an inanimate object, a table, or an animate object, a person. The pushing or pulling may be done by a person, or even the gravitational pull of Earth. Forces have different magnitudes and directions; this means that some forces are stronger than others and can act in different directions. For example, a cannon exerts a strong force on the cannonball that is launched into the air. In contrast, a mosquito landing on your arm exerts only a small force on your arm. When multiple forces act on an object, the forces combine. Adding together all of the forces acting on an object gives the total force, or net force. An external force is a force that acts on an object within the system from outside the system. This type of force is different than an internal force, which acts between two objects that are both within the system. The net external force combines these two definitions; it is the total combined external force. We discuss further details about net force, external force, and net external force in the coming sections. Like displacements, velocities, and accelerations, forces are vectors that have magnitude and direction. We may represent a force as the sum of two vectors at right angles. These are its one-dimensional components, which we can represent by a signed scalar quantity. When we do so, we must choose a coordinate system and the direction along each axis that will be the positive direction. This choice must be the same for all vectors in the problem—forces, accelerations, etc. Commonly, in a problem set in a vertical plane, horizontal and vertical axes are chosen as the two primary directions. The usual convention is to make the positive directions right and up. Sometimes a problem concerns a sloping plane, and it may be more convenient to choose axes parallel to the plane and normal to it. In this case, it is usual to take positive in each axis as the directions that tend upward. Thus, a horizontal force of –3 N means pushing with 3 N to the left. Unknown values are taken to be in the positive direction, so if your calculation of a vertical force comes out as +5.2 N, then you know it is an upward force. A negative result means the force is downward. Free-Body Diagrams and Examples of Forces Teacher Support [BL] Review vectors and how they are represented. Review vector addition. [AL] Ask students to give everyday examples of situations where multiple forces act together. Draw free-body diagrams for some of these situations. For our first example of force, consider an object hanging from a rope. This example gives us the opportunity to introduce a useful tool known as a free-body diagram. A free-body diagram represents the object being acted upon—that is, the free body—as a single point. Only the forces acting on the body (that is, external forces) are shown and are represented by vectors (which are drawn as arrows). These forces are the only ones shown because only external forces acting on the body affect its motion. We can ignore any internal forces within the body because they cancel each other out, as explained in the section on Newton’s third law of motion. Free-body diagrams are very useful for analyzing forces acting on an object. An object of mass, m, is held up by the force of tension. shows the force of tension in the rope acting in the upward direction, opposite the force of gravity. The forces are indicated in the free-body diagram by an arrow pointing up, representing tension, and another arrow pointing down, representing gravity. In a free-body diagram, the lengths of the arrows show the relative magnitude (or strength) of the forces. Because forces are vectors, they add just like other vectors. Notice that the two arrows have equal lengths in , which means that the forces of tension and weight are of equal magnitude. Because these forces of equal magnitude act in opposite directions, they are perfectly balanced, so they add together to give a net force of zero. Not all forces are as noticeable as when you push or pull on an object. Some forces act without physical contact, such as the pull of a magnet (in the case of magnetic force) or the gravitational pull of Earth (in the case of gravitational force). In the next three sections discussing Newton’s laws of motion, we will learn about three specific types of forces: friction, the normal force, and the gravitational force. To analyze situations involving forces, we will create free-body diagrams to organize the framework of the mathematics for each individual situation. Correctly drawing and labeling a free-body diagram is an important first step for solving a problem. It will help you visualize the problem and correctly apply the mathematics to solve the problem. Section Summary Dynamics is the study of how forces affect the motion of objects and systems. Force is a push or pull that can be defined in terms of various standards. It is a vector and so has both magnitude and direction. External forces are any forces outside of a body that act on the body. A free-body diagram is a drawing of all external forces acting on a body. Check Your Understanding Teacher Support Use the questions in Check Your Understanding to assess whether students have mastered the learning objectives of this section. If students are struggling with a specific objective, the Check Your Understanding assessment will help identify which objective is causing the problem and direct students to the relevant content. Do two bodies have to be in physical contact to exert a force upon one another? No, the gravitational force is a field force and does not require physical contact to exert a force. No, the gravitational force is a contact force and does not require physical contact to exert a force. Yes, the gravitational force is a field force and requires physical contact to exert a force. Yes, the gravitational force is a contact force and requires physical contact to exert a force. Which forces can be represented in a free-body diagram? Internal forces External forces Both internal and external forces A body that is not influenced by any force Concept Items What is dynamics? Dynamics is the study of internal forces. Dynamics is the study of forces and their effect on motion. Dynamics describes the motion of points, bodies, and systems without consideration of the cause of motion. Dynamics describes the effect of forces on each other. Two forces acting on an object are perpendicular to one another. How would you draw these in a free-body diagram? The two force arrows will be drawn at a right angle to one another. The two force arrows will be pointing in opposite directions. The two force arrows will be at a 45° angle to one another. The two force arrows will be at a 180° angle to one another. A free-body diagram shows the forces acting on an object. How is that object represented in the diagram? A single point A square box A unit circle The object as it is Critical Thinking Only two forces are acting on an object: force A to the left and force B to the right. If force B is greater than force A, in which direction will the object move, given that the object starts from rest? To the right To the left Upward The object does not move In a free-body diagram, the arrows representing tension and weight have the same length but point away from one another. What does this indicate? They are equal in magnitude and act in the same direction. They are equal in magnitude and act in opposite directions. They are unequal in magnitude and act in the same direction. They are unequal in magnitude and act in opposite directions. An object is at rest. Two forces, X and Y, are acting on it. Force X has a magnitude of x and acts in the downward direction. What is the magnitude and direction of Y, given that the object remains at rest? The magnitude is x and points in the upward direction. The magnitude is 2x and points in the upward direction. The magnitude is x and points in the downward direction. The magnitude is 2x and points in the downward direction. Three forces, A, B, and C, are acting on the same object with magnitudes a, b, and c, respectively. Force A acts to the right, force B acts to the left, and force C acts downward. What is a necessary condition for the object to move straight down? The magnitude of force A must be greater than the magnitude of force B, so a > b. The magnitude of force A must be equal to the magnitude of force B, so a = b. The magnitude of force A must be greater than the magnitude of force C, so A > C. The magnitude of force C must be greater than the magnitude of forces A or B, so A < C > B.

Teacher Support The learning objectives in this section will help students master the following standards: (4) Science concepts. The student knows and applies the laws governing motion in a variety of situations. The student is expected to: (D) calculate the effect of forces on objects, including the law of inertia, the relationship between force and acceleration, and the nature of force pairs between objects. Before students begin this section, it is useful to review the concepts of force, external force, net external force, and addition of forces. [BL][OL][AL] Ask students to speculate what happens to objects when they are set in motion. Do they remain in motion or stop after some time? Why? Students may believe that objects that are in motion tend to slow down and stop. Explain the concept of friction. Talk about objects in outer space, where there is no atmosphere and no gravity. Ask students to describe the motion of such objects. Section Key Terms friction inertia law of inertia mass Newton’s first law of motion system Newton’s First Law and Friction Teacher Support [BL][OL][AL] Discuss examples of Newton’s first law seen in everyday life. [BL][OL][AL] Talk about different pairs of surfaces and how each exhibits different levels of friction. Ask students to give examples of smooth and rough surfaces. Ask them where friction may be useful and where it may be undesirable. [OL][AL] Ask students to give different examples of systems where multiple forces occur. Draw free-body diagrams for these. Include the force of friction. Emphasize the direction of the force of friction. Newton’s first law of motion states the following: A body at rest tends to remain at rest. A body in motion tends to remain in motion at a constant velocity unless acted on by a net external force. (Recall that constant velocity means that the body moves in a straight line and at a constant speed.) At first glance, this law may seem to contradict your everyday experience. You have probably noticed that a moving object will usually slow down and stop unless some effort is made to keep it moving. The key to understanding why, for example, a sliding box slows down (seemingly on its own) is to first understand that a net external force acts on the box to make the box slow down. Without this net external force, the box would continue to slide at a constant velocity (as stated in Newton’s first law of motion). What force acts on the box to slow it down? This force is called friction. Generally, friction is an external force that acts opposite to the direction of relative motion or to prevent slipping. We further identify different types of friction. Kinetic friction is a force by a surface parallel to the surface that opposes the motion of a sliding object and causes it to slow down. When the friction prevents the object from sliding, it is called static friction. Rolling resistance impedes the rolling of a wheel. Drag opposes and slows the motion of an object through a fluid (see ). Think of friction as a resistance to motion that slows things down. Consider an air hockey table. When the air is turned off, the puck slides only a short distance before friction slows it to a stop. However, when the air is turned on, it lifts the puck slightly, so the puck experiences very little friction as it moves over the surface. With friction almost eliminated, the puck glides along with very little change in speed. On a frictionless surface, the puck would experience no net external force (ignoring air resistance, which is also a form of friction). Additionally, if we know enough about friction, we can accurately predict how quickly objects will slow down. Now let’s think about another example. A man pushes a box across a floor at constant velocity by applying a force of +50 N. (The positive sign indicates that, by convention, the direction of motion is to the right.) What is the force of friction that opposes the motion? The force of friction must be −50 N. Why? According to Newton’s first law of motion, any object moving at constant velocity has no net external force acting upon it, which means that the sum of the forces acting on the object must be zero. The mathematical way to say that no net external force acts on an object is F net = 0 or ΣF=0. So if the man applies +50 N of force, then the force of friction must be −50 N for the two forces to add up to zero (that is, for the two forces to cancel each other). Whenever you encounter the phrase at constant velocity, Newton’s first law tells you that the net external force is zero. For a box sliding across a floor, friction acts in the direction opposite to the velocity. The force of friction depends on two factors: the coefficient of friction and the normal force. For any two surfaces that are in contact with one another, the coefficient of friction is a constant that depends on the nature of the surfaces. The normal force is the force exerted by a surface that pushes on an object out, perpendicular to the surface in response to the object’s pushing into the surface. The normal force prevents the object from penetrating the surface. In equation form, the force of friction is f=μN, where μ is the coefficient of friction and N is the normal force. (The coefficient of friction is discussed in more detail in another chapter, and the normal force is discussed in more detail in the section Newton's Third Law of Motion.)Recall from the section on Force that a net external force acts from outside on the object of interest. A more precise definition is that it acts on the system of interest. A system is one or more objects that you choose to study. It is important to define the system at the beginning of a problem to figure out which forces are external and need to be considered, and which are internal and can be ignored. For example, in (a), two children push a third child in a wagon at a constant velocity. The system of interest is the wagon plus the small child, as shown in part (b) of the figure. The two children behind the wagon exert external forces on this system (F1, F2). Friction f acting on the wheels is another external force acting on the system. Two more external forces act on the system: the weight W of the system pulling down and the normal force N of the ground pushing up. Notice that the wagon is not accelerating vertically, so Newton’s first law tells us that the normal force balances the weight. Because the wagon is moving forward at a constant velocity, the force of friction must have the same strength as the sum of the forces applied by the two children. (a) The wagon and rider form a system that is acted on by external forces. (b) The two children pushing the wagon and child provide two external forces. Friction acting at the wheel axles and on the surface of the tires where they touch the ground provide an external force that act against the direction of motion. The weight W and the normal force N from the ground are two more external forces acting on the system. All external forces are represented in the figure by arrows. All of the external forces acting on the system add together, but because the wagon moves at a constant velocity, all of the forces must add up to zero. Mass and Inertia Teacher Support [BL] Review Newton’s first law. Explain that the property of objects to maintain their state of motion is called inertia. [OL][AL] Take two similar carts or trolleys with wheels. Place a heavy weight in one of them. Ask students which cart would require more force to change its state of motion. Ask students which would stay in motion longer if you were to set them in motion. Based on this discussion, have students speculate on what inertia may depend on. [BL][OL] Explain the concepts of mass and weight. Explain that these terms may be used interchangeably in everyday life but have different meanings in science. Inertia is the tendency for an object at rest to remain at rest, or for a moving object to remain in motion in a straight line with constant speed. This key property of objects was first described by Galileo. Later, Newton incorporated the concept of inertia into his first law, which is often referred to as the law of inertia. As we know from experience, some objects have more inertia than others. For example, changing the motion of a large truck is more difficult than changing the motion of a toy truck. In fact, the inertia of an object is proportional to the mass of the object. Mass is a measure of the amount of matter (or stuff) in an object. The quantity or amount of matter in an object is determined by the number and types of atoms the object contains. Unlike weight (which changes if the gravitational force changes), mass does not depend on gravity. The mass of an object is the same on Earth, in orbit, or on the surface of the moon. In practice, it is very difficult to count and identify all of the atoms and molecules in an object, so mass is usually not determined this way. Instead, the mass of an object is determined by comparing it with the standard kilogram. Mass is therefore expressed in kilograms. In everyday language, people often use the terms weight and mass interchangeably—but this is not correct. Weight is actually a force. (We cover this topic in more detail in the section Newton's Second Law of Motion.) Newton’s First Law of Motion This video contrasts the way we thought about motion and force in the time before Galileo’s concept of inertia and Newton’s first law of motion with the way we understand force and motion now. Before we understood that objects have a tendency to maintain their velocity in a straight line unless acted upon by a net force, people thought that objects had a tendency to stop on their own. This happened because a specific force was not yet understood. What was that force? Gravitational force Electrostatic force Nuclear force Frictional force Forces and Motion—Basics In this simulation, you will first explore net force by placing blue people on the left side of a tug-of-war rope and red people on the right side of the rope (by clicking people and dragging them with your mouse). Experiment with changing the number and size of people on each side to see how it affects the outcome of the match and the net force. Hit the \"Go!\" button to start the match, and the “reset all” button to start over.Next, click on the Friction tab. Try selecting different objects for the person to push. Slide the applied force button to the right to apply force to the right, and to the left to apply force to the left. The force will continue to be applied as long as you hold down the button. See the arrow representing friction change in magnitude and direction, depending on how much force you apply. Try increasing or decreasing the friction force to see how this change affects the motion. Click on the tab for the Acceleration Lab and check the Sum of Forces option. Push the box to the right and then release. Notice which direction the sum of forces arrow points after the person stops pushing the box and lets it continue moving to the right on its own. At this point, in which direction is the net force, the sum of forces, pointing? Why? The net force acts to the right because the applied external force acted to the right. The net force acts to the left because the applied external force acted to the left. The net force acts to the right because the frictional force acts to the right. The net force acts to the left because the frictional force acts to the left. Section Summary Newton’s first law states that a body at rest remains at rest or, if moving, remains in motion in a straight line at a constant speed, unless acted on by a net external force. This law is also known as the law of inertia. Inertia is the tendency of an object at rest to remain at rest or, if moving, to remain in motion at constant velocity. Inertia is related to an object’s mass. Friction is a force that opposes motion and causes an object or system to slow down. Mass is the quantity of matter in a substance. Key Equations Newton's first law of motion F net = 0 or ΣF=0 Teacher Support Use the questions in Check Your Understanding to assess whether students have mastered the learning objectives of this section. If students are struggling with a specific objective, the Check Your Understanding assessment will help identify which objective is causing the problem and direct students to the relevant content. Check Your Understanding What does Newtons first law state? A body at rest tends to remain at rest and a body in motion tends to remain in motion at a constant acceleration unless acted on by a net external force. A body at rest tends to remain at rest and a body in motion tends to remain in motion at a constant velocity unless acted on by a net external force. The rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the external force applied to the body. The rate of change of momentum of a body is inversely proportional to the external force applied to the body. According to Newtons first law, a body in motion tends to remain in motion at a constant velocity. However, when you slide an object across a surface, the object eventually slows down and stops. Why? The object experiences a frictional force exerted by the surface, which opposes its motion. The object experiences the gravitational force exerted by Earth, which opposes its motion The object experiences an internal force exerted by the body itself, which opposes its motion. The object experiences a pseudo-force from the body in motion, which opposes its motion. What is mass? What does it depend on? Mass is the weight of an object, and it depends on the gravitational force acting on the object. Mass is the weight of an object, and it depends on the number and types of atoms in the object. Mass is the quantity of matter contained in an object, and it depends on the gravitational force acting on the object. Mass is the quantity of matter contained in an object, and it depends on the number and types of atoms in the object. Concept Items A ball rolls along the ground, moving from north to south.

Fnet = −1 Fnet = 0 Fnet = 1 Fnet = ∞ Critical Thinking Two people push a cart on a horizontal surface by applying forces F1 and F2 in the same direction. Is the magnitude of the net force acting on the cart, Fnet, equal to, greater than, or less than F1 + F2? Why? Fnet < F1 + F2 because the net force will not include the frictional force. Fnet = F1 + F2 because the net force will not include the frictional force Fnet < F1 + F2 because the net force will include the component of frictional force Fnet = F1 + F2 because the net force will include the frictional force True or False: A book placed on a balance scale is balanced by a standard 1-kg iron weight placed on the opposite side of the balance. If these objects are taken to the moon and a similar exercise is performed, the balance is still level because gravity is uniform on the moons surface as it is on Earths surface.

The bike has more inertia, as its mass is greater than the mass of the car. The car has more inertia, as its mass is less than the mass of the bike. The bike has more inertia, as its mass is less than the mass of the car.

One is empty and the other is filled with pebbles. Without opening or lifting either, how can you tell which box is full? Why? By applying an internal force; whichever box accelerates faster is lighter and so must be empty By applying an internal force; whichever box accelerates faster is heavier and so the other box must be empty By applying an external force; whichever box accelerates faster is lighter and so must be empty By applying an external force; whichever box accelerates faster is heavier and so the other box must be empty True or FalseAn external force is required to set a stationary object in motion in outer space away from all gravitational influences and atmospheric friction.

The student knows and applies the laws governing motion in a variety of situations. The student is expected to: (D) calculate the effect of forces on objects, including the law of inertia, the relationship between force and acceleration, and the nature of force pairs between objects. Before beginning this section, review forces, acceleration, acceleration due to gravity (g), friction, inertia, and Newton’s first law. Section Key Terms freefall Newton’s second law of motion weight Describing Newton’s Second Law of Motion Teacher Support [BL][OL] Review the concepts of inertia and Newton’s first law. Explain that, according to Newton’s first law, a change in motion is caused by an external force. For instance, a ball that is pitched changes its speed and direction when it is hit by a bat. [BL][OL][AL] Write the equation for Newton’s second law and show how it can be solved for all three variables, F, m, and a. Explain the practical implications for each case. Ask students how the other two variables would behave if one quantity is held constant. Students might confuse the terms equal and proportional. Newton’s first law considered bodies at rest or bodies in motion at a constant velocity. The other state of motion to consider is when an object is moving with a changing velocity, which means a change in the speed and/or the direction of motion. This type of motion is addressed by Newton’s second law of motion, which states how force causes changes in motion. Newton’s second law of motion is used to calculate what happens in situations involving forces and motion, and it shows the mathematical relationship between force, mass, and acceleration. Mathematically, the second law is most often written as F net =maorΣF=ma, where Fnet (or ∑F) is the net external force, m is the mass of the system, and a is the acceleration. Note that Fnet and ∑F are the same because the net external force is the sum of all the external forces acting on the system.First, what do we mean by a change in motion? A change in motion is simply a change in velocity: the speed of an object can become slower or faster, the direction in which the object is moving can change, or both of these variables may change. A change in velocity means, by definition, that an acceleration has occurred. Newton’s first law says that only a nonzero net external force can cause a change in motion, so a net external force must cause an acceleration. Note that acceleration can refer to slowing down or to speeding up. Acceleration can also refer to a change in the direction of motion with no change in speed, because acceleration is the change in velocity divided by the time it takes for that change to occur, and velocity is defined by speed and direction.From the equation F net =ma, we see that force is directly proportional to both mass and acceleration, which makes sense. To accelerate two objects from rest to the same velocity, you would expect more force to be required to accelerate the more massive object. Likewise, for two objects of the same mass, applying a greater force to one would accelerate it to a greater velocity.Now, let’s rearrange Newton’s second law to solve for acceleration. We get a= F net m ora= ΣF m . In this form, we can see that acceleration is directly proportional to force, which we write as a∝ F net , where the symbol ∝ means proportional to. This proportionality mathematically states what we just said in words: acceleration is directly proportional to the net external force. When two variables are directly proportional to each other, then if one variable doubles, the other variable must double. Likewise, if one variable is reduced by half, the other variable must also be reduced by half. In general, when one variable is multiplied by a number, the other variable is also multiplied by the same number. It seems reasonable that the acceleration of a system should be directly proportional to and in the same direction as the net external force acting on the system. An object experiences greater acceleration when acted on by a greater force.It is also clear from the equation a= F net /m that acceleration is inversely proportional to mass, which we write as a ∝ 1 m . Inversely proportional means that if one variable is multiplied by a number, the other variable must be divided by the same number. Now, it also seems reasonable that acceleration should be inversely proportional to the mass of the system. In other words, the larger the mass (the inertia), the smaller the acceleration produced by a given force. This relationship is illustrated in , which shows that a given net external force applied to a basketball produces a much greater acceleration than when applied to a car. The same force exerted on systems of different masses produces different accelerations. (a) A boy pushes a basketball to make a pass. The effect of gravity on the ball is ignored. (b) The same boy pushing with identical force on a stalled car produces a far smaller acceleration (friction is negligible). Note that the free-body diagrams for the ball and for the car are identical, which allows us to compare the two situations. Applying Newton’s Second Law Teacher Support [BL] Review how to convert between units. [OL][AL] Ask students to give examples of Newton’s second law. Students might confuse weight, which is a force, and g, which is the acceleration due to gravity. [BL][OL][AL] Ask students if they think an astronaut weighs the same on the moon as they do on Earth. Talk about the difference between mass and weight. Before putting Newton’s second law into action, it is important to consider units. The equation F net =ma is used to define the units of force in terms of the three basic units of mass, length, and time (recall that acceleration has units of length divided by time squared). The SI unit of force is called the newton (abbreviated N) and is the force needed to accelerate a 1-kg system at the rate of 1 m/s2. That is, because F net =ma, we have 1N=1kg×1 m/s 2 =1 kg⋅m s 2 . One of the most important applications of Newton’s second law is to calculate weight (also known as the gravitational force), which is usually represented mathematically as W. When people talk about gravity, they don’t always realize that it is an acceleration. When an object is dropped, it accelerates toward the center of Earth. Newton’s second law states that the net external force acting on an object is responsible for the acceleration of the object. If air resistance is negligible, the net external force on a falling object is only the gravitational force (i.e., the weight of the object).Weight can be represented by a vector because it has a direction. Down is defined as the direction in which gravity pulls, so weight is normally considered a downward force. By using Newton’s second law, we can figure out the equation for weight.Consider an object with mass m falling toward Earth. It experiences only the force of gravity (i.e., the gravitational force or weight), which is represented by W. Newton’s second law states that F net =ma. Because the only force acting on the object is the gravitational force, we have F net =W. We know that the acceleration of an object due to gravity is g, so we have a=g. Substituting these two expressions into Newton’s second law gives W=mg. This is the equation for weight—the gravitational force on a mass m. On Earth, g=9.80 m/s 2 , so the weight (disregarding for now the direction of the weight) of a 1.0-kg object on Earth is W=mg=(1.0 kg)(9 .80 m/s 2 )=9.8 N. Although most of the world uses newtons as the unit of force, in the United States the most familiar unit of force is the pound (lb), where 1 N = 0.225 lb. Recall that although gravity acts downward, it can be assigned a positive or negative value, depending on what the positive direction is in your chosen coordinate system. Be sure to take this into consideration when solving problems with weight. When the downward direction is taken to be negative, as is often the case, acceleration due to gravity becomes –g = −9.8 m/s2 and the weight force is –mg.When the net external force on an object is its weight, we say that it is in freefall. In this case, the only force acting on the object is the force of gravity. On the surface of Earth, when objects fall downward toward Earth, they are never truly in freefall because there is always some upward force due to air resistance that acts on the object (and there is also the buoyancy force of air, which is similar to the buoyancy force in water that keeps boats afloat). Gravity varies slightly over the surface of Earth, so the weight of an object depends very slightly on its location on Earth. Weight varies dramatically away from Earth’s surface. On the moon, for example, the acceleration due to gravity is only 1.67 m/s2. Because weight depends on the force of gravity, a 1.0-kg mass weighs 9.8 N on Earth and only about 1.7 N on the moon. It is important to remember that weight and mass are very different, although they are closely related. Mass is the quantity of matter in an object (how much stuff there is, or how hard it is to accelerate it) and does not vary, but weight is the gravitational force on an object and is proportional to the force of gravity. It is easy to confuse the two, because our experience is confined to Earth, and the weight of an object is essentially the same no matter where you are on Earth. Adding to the confusion, the terms mass and weight are often used interchangeably in everyday language; for example, our medical records often show our weight in kilograms, but never in the correct unit of newtons. Mass and Weight Teacher Support Explain that even though a scale gives a mass, it actually measures weight. Scales are calibrated to show the correct mass on Earth. They would give different results on the moon, because the force of gravity is weaker on the moon. In this activity, you will use a scale to investigate mass and weight. 1 bathroom scale 1 table What do bathroom scales measure? When you stand on a bathroom scale, what happens to the scale? It depresses slightly. The scale contains springs that compress in proportion to your weight—similar to rubber bands expanding when pulled. The springs provide a measure of your weight (provided you are not accelerating). This is a force in newtons (or pounds). In most countries, the measurement is now divided by 9.80 to give a reading in kilograms, which is a of mass. The scale detects weight but is calibrated to display mass. If you went to the moon and stood on your scale, would it detect the same mass as it did on Earth? While standing on a bathroom scale, push down on a table next to you. What happens to the reading? Why? The reading increases because part of your weight is applied to the table and the table exerts a matching force on you that acts in the direction of your weight. The reading increases because part of your weight is applied to the table and the table exerts a matching force on you that acts in the direction opposite to your weight. The reading decreases because part of your weight is applied to the table and the table exerts a matching force on you that acts in the direction of your weight. The reading decreases because part of your weight is applied to the table and the table exerts a matching force on you that acts in the direction opposite to your weight. Only net external force impacts the acceleration of an object. If more than one force acts on an object and you calculate the acceleration by using only one of these forces, you will not get the correct acceleration for that object. Newton’s Second Law of Motion This video reviews Newton’s second law of motion and how net external force and acceleration relate to one another and to mass. It also covers units of force, mass, and acceleration, and reviews a worked-out example. True or False If you want to reduce the acceleration of an object to half its original value, then you would need to reduce the net external force by half. True False What Acceleration Can a Person Produce when Pushing a Lawn Mower? Suppose that the net external force (push minus friction) exerted on a lawn mower is 51 N parallel to the ground. The mass of the mower is 240 kg. What is its acceleration? Strategy Because Fnet and m are given, the acceleration can be calculated directly from Newton’s second law: Fnet = ma. Solution Solving Newton’s second law for the acceleration, we find that the magnitude of the acceleration, a, is a= F net m . Entering the given values for net external force and mass gives a= 51 N 240 kg Inserting the units kg⋅ m/s 2 for N yields a= 51 kg⋅ m/s 2 240 kg =0.21 m/s 2 . Discussion The acceleration is in the same direction as the net external force, which is parallel to the ground and to the right. There is no information given in this example about the individual external forces acting on the system, but we can say something about their relative magnitudes. For example, the force exerted by the person pushing the mower must be greater than the friction opposing the motion, because we are given that the net external force is in the direction in which the person pushes. Also, the vertical forces must cancel if there is no acceleration in the vertical direction (the mower is moving only horizontally). The acceleration found is reasonable for a person pushing a mower; the mower’s speed must increase by 0.21 m/s every second, which is possible. The time during which the mower accelerates would not be very long because the person’s top speed would soon be reached. At this point, the person could push a little less hard, because he only has to overcome friction. What Rocket Thrust Accelerates This Sled? Prior to manned space flights, rocket sleds were used to test aircraft, missile equipment, and physiological effects on humans at high accelerations. Rocket sleds consisted of a platform mounted on one or two rails and propelled by several rockets. Calculate the magnitude of force exerted by each rocket, called its thrust, T, for the four-rocket propulsion system shown below. The sled’s initial acceleration is 49 m/s 2 , the mass of the system is 2,100 kg, and the force of friction opposing the motion is 650 N. Strategy The system of interest is the rocket sled. Although forces act vertically on the system, they must cancel because the system does not accelerate vertically. This leaves us with only horizontal forces to consider. We’ll assign the direction to the right as the positive direction. See the free-body diagram in Figure 4.8. Solution We start with Newton’s second law and look for ways to find the thrust T of the engines. Because all forces and acceleration are along a line, we need only consider the magnitudes of these quantities in the calculations. We begin with F net =ma, where F net is the net external force in the horizontal direction. We can see from Figure 4.8 that the engine thrusts are in the same direction (which we call the positive direction), whereas friction opposes the thrust. In equation form, the net external force is F net =4T−f. Newton’s second law tells us that Fnet= ma, so we get ma=4T−f. After a little algebra, we solve for the total thrust 4T: 4T=ma+f, which means that the individual thrust is T= ma+f 4 . Inserting the known values yields T= (2100 kg)(49 m/s 2 )+650 N 4 =2.6× 10 4 N. Discussion The numbers are quite large, so the result might surprise you. Experiments such as this were performed in the early 1960s to test the limits of human endurance and to test the apparatus designed to protect fighter pilots in emergency ejections. Speeds of 1000 km/h were obtained, with accelerations of 45 g. (Recall that g, the acceleration due to gravity, is 9 .80 m/s 2 . An acceleration of 45 g is 45×9 .80 m/s 2 , which is approximately 440 m/s 2 . ) Living subjects are no longer used, and land speeds of 10,000 km/h have now been obtained with rocket sleds. In this example, as in the preceding example, the system of interest is clear. We will see in later examples that choosing the system of interest is crucial—and that the choice is not always obvious. Practice Problems If 1 N is equal to 0.225 lb, how many pounds is 5 N of force? 0.045 lb 1.125 lb 2.025 lb 5.000 lb How much force needs to be applied to a 5-kg object for it to accelerate at 20 m/s2? 1 N 10 N 100 N 1,000 N Section Summary Acceleration is a change in velocity, meaning a change in speed, direction, or both. An external force acts on a system from outside the system, as opposed to internal forces, which act between components within the system. Newton’s second law of motion states that the acceleration of a system is directly proportional to and in the same direction as the net external force acting on the system, and inversely proportional to the system’s mass. In equation form, Newton’s second law of motion is F net =ma or ΣF=ma . This is sometimes written as a= F net m or a= ΣF m . The weight of an object of mass m is the force of gravity that acts on it. From Newton’s second law, weight is given by W=mg. If the only force acting on an object is its weight, then the object is in freefall.

Force, mass, and time Force, mass, and displacement Force, mass, and velocity Force, mass, and acceleration Concept Items What does it mean for two quantities to be inversely proportional to each other? When one variable increases, the other variable decreases by a greater amount. When one variable increases, the other variable also increases. When one variable increases, the other variable decreases by the same factor. When one variable increases, the other variable also increases by the same factor. True or False: Newton's second law can be interpreted based on Newton's first law. True False Critical Thinking From the equation for Newtons second law, we see that Fnet is directly proportional to a and that the constant of proportionality is m. What does this mean in a practical sense? An increase in applied force will cause an increase in acceleration if the mass is constant. An increase in applied force will cause a decrease in acceleration if the mass is constant. An increase in applied force will cause an increase in acceleration, even if the mass varies. An increase in applied force will cause an increase in acceleration and mass. Problems A bathroom scale shows your mass as 55 kg.

The student knows and applies the laws governing motion in a variety of situations. The student is expected to: (D) calculate the effect of forces on objects, including the law of inertia, the relationship between force and acceleration, and the nature of force pairs between objects. Section Key Terms Newton’s third law of motion normal force tension thrust Describing Newton’s Third Law of Motion Teacher Support [BL][OL] Review Newton’s first and second laws. [AL] Start a discussion about action and reaction by giving examples. Introduce the concepts of systems and systems of interest. Explain how forces can be classified as internal or external to the system of interest. Give examples of systems. Ask students which forces are internal and which are external in each scenario. If you have ever stubbed your toe, you have noticed that although your toe initiates the impact, the surface that you stub it on exerts a force back on your toe. Although the first thought that crosses your mind is probably “ouch, that hurt” rather than “this is a great example of Newton’s third law,” both statements are true. This is exactly what happens whenever one object exerts a force on another—each object experiences a force that is the same strength as the force acting on the other object but that acts in the opposite direction. Everyday experiences, such as stubbing a toe or throwing a ball, are all perfect examples of Newton’s third law in action. Newton’s third law of motion states that whenever a first object exerts a force on a second object, the first object experiences a force equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the force that it exerts. Newton’s third law of motion tells us that forces always occur in pairs, and one object cannot exert a force on another without experiencing the same strength force in return. We sometimes refer to these force pairs as action-reaction pairs, where the force exerted is the action, and the force experienced in return is the reaction (although which is which depends on your point of view). Newton’s third law is useful for figuring out which forces are external to a system. Recall that identifying external forces is important when setting up a problem, because the external forces must be added together to find the net force.We can see Newton’s third law at work by looking at how people move about. Consider a swimmer pushing off from the side of a pool, as illustrated in . She pushes against the pool wall with her feet and accelerates in the direction opposite to her push. The wall has thus exerted on the swimmer a force of equal magnitude but in the direction opposite that of her push. You might think that two forces of equal magnitude but that act in opposite directions would cancel, but they do not because they act on different systems. In this case, there are two different systems that we could choose to investigate: the swimmer or the wall. If we choose the swimmer to be the system of interest, as in the figure, then F wall on feet is an external force on the swimmer and affects her motion. Because acceleration is in the same direction as the net external force, the swimmer moves in the direction of F wall on feet . Because the swimmer is our system (or object of interest) and not the wall, we do not need to consider the force F feet on wall because it originates from the swimmer rather than acting on the swimmer. Therefore, F feet on wall does not directly affect the motion of the system and does not cancel F wall on feet . Note that the swimmer pushes in the direction opposite to the direction in which she wants to move. When the swimmer exerts a force F feet on wall on the wall, she accelerates in the direction opposite to that of her push. This means that the net external force on her is in the direction opposite to F feet on wall . This opposition is the result of Newton’s third law of motion, which dictates that the wall exerts a force F wall on feet on the swimmer that is equal in magnitude but that acts in the direction opposite to the force that the swimmer exerts on the wall.Other examples of Newton’s third law are easy to find. As a teacher paces in front of a whiteboard, he exerts a force backward on the floor. The floor exerts a reaction force in the forward direction on the teacher that causes him to accelerate forward. Similarly, a car accelerates because the ground pushes forward on the car's wheels in reaction to the car's wheels pushing backward on the ground. You can see evidence of the wheels pushing backward when tires spin on a gravel road and throw rocks backward. Another example is the force of a baseball as it makes contact with the bat. Helicopters create lift by pushing air down, creating an upward reaction force. Birds fly by exerting force on air in the direction opposite that in which they wish to fly. For example, the wings of a bird force air downward and backward in order to get lift and move forward. An octopus propels itself forward in the water by ejecting water backward through a funnel in its body, which is similar to how a jet ski is propelled. In these examples, the octopus or jet ski push the water backward, and the water, in turn, pushes the octopus or jet ski forward. Applying Newton’s Third Law Teacher Support [BL] Review the concept of weight as a force. [OL] Ask students what happens when an object is dropped from a height. Why does it stop when it hits the ground? Introduce the term normal force. [BL][OL][AL] Demonstrate the concept of tension by using physical objects. Suspend an object such as an eraser from a peg by using a rubber band. Hang another rubber band beside the first but with no object attached. Ask students what the difference is between the two. What are the forces acting on the first peg? Explain how the rubber band (i.e., the connector) transmits force. Now ask students what the direction of the external forces acting on the connectoris. Also, ask what internal forces are acting on the connector. If you remove the eraser, in which direction will the rubber band move? This is the direction of the force the rubber band applied to the eraser. Forces are classified and given names based on their source, how they are transmitted, or their effects. In previous sections, we discussed the forces called push, weight, and friction. In this section, applying Newton’s third law of motion will allow us to explore three more forces: the normal force, tension, and thrust. However, because we haven’t yet covered vectors in depth, we’ll only consider one-dimensional situations in this chapter. Another chapter will consider forces acting in two dimensions. As we will see, we often apply the third law in conjunction with the second law in order to analyze the forces. The gravitational force (or weight) acts on objects at all times and everywhere on Earth. We know from Newton’s second law that a net force produces an acceleration; so, why is everything not in a constant state of freefall toward the center of Earth? The answer is the normal force. The normal force is the outward force that a surface applies to an object perpendicular to the surface, and it prevents the object from penetrating it. The normal force is a third law reaction force to the object’s force into the surface. In the case of an object at rest on a horizontal surface, it is the force needed to support the weight of that object. If an object on a flat surface is not accelerating, the net external force is zero and, as a consequence of Newton's second (not third!) law, the normal force has the same magnitude as the weight of the system but acts in the opposite direction. In equation form, we write that N=mg. Note that this equation is only true for a horizontal surface. This does not violate the third law since gravity and the normal force are not third law pairs. The word tension comes from the Latin word meaning to stretch. Tension is the force along the length of a flexible connector, such as a string, rope, chain, or cable. Regardless of the type of connector attached to the object of interest, one must remember that the connector can only pull (or exert tension) in the direction parallel to its length. Tension is a pull that acts parallel to the connector, and that acts in opposite directions at the two ends of the connector. This is possible because a flexible connector is simply a long series of action-reaction forces, except at the two ends where outside objects provide one member of the action-reaction forces. Consider a person holding a mass on a rope, as shown in . When a perfectly flexible connector (one requiring no force to bend it) such as a rope transmits a force T, this force must be parallel to the length of the rope, as shown. The pull that such a flexible connector exerts is a tension. The rope pulls at one end on the hand with equal magnitude force but in opposite directions to the hand’s pull. At the other end, it pulls on the mass with equal magnitude force and in the opposite direction to the mass’s pull. These are examples of Newton’s third law. If we neglect the weight of the rope, or if the system is at rest, Newton’s second law then leads to the forces at the two ends being equal. Tension in the rope must equal the weight of the supported mass, as we can prove by using Newton’s second law. If the 5.00 kg mass in the figure is stationary, then its acceleration is zero, so F net =0. The only external forces acting on the mass are its weight W and the tension T supplied by the rope. Summing the external forces to find the net force, we obtain F net =T−W=0, where T and W are the magnitudes of the tension and weight, respectively, and their signs indicate direction, with up being positive. By substituting mg for Fnet and rearranging the equation, the tension equals the weight of the supported mass, just as you would expect T=W=mg. For a 5.00-kg mass (neglecting the mass of the rope), we see that T=mg=(5.00 kg)(9 .80 m/s 2 )=49.0 N. Another example of Newton’s third law in action is thrust. Rockets move forward by expelling gas backward at a high velocity. This means that the rocket exerts a large force backward on the gas in the rocket combustion chamber, and the gas, in turn, exerts a large force forward on the rocket in response. This reaction force is called thrust. A common misconception is that rockets propel themselves by pushing on the ground or on the air behind them. They actually work better in a vacuum, where they can expel exhaust gases more easily. Math: Problem-Solving Strategy for Newton’s Laws of Motion The basics of problem solving, presented earlier in this text, are followed here with specific strategies for applying Newton’s laws of motion. These techniques also reinforce concepts that are useful in many other areas of physics. First, identify the physical principles involved. If the problem involves forces, then Newton’s laws of motion are involved, and it is important to draw a careful sketch of the situation. An example of a sketch is shown in . Next, as in , use vectors to represent all forces. Label the forces carefully, and make sure that their lengths are proportional to the magnitude of the forces and that the arrows point in the direction in which the forces act. (a) A sketch of Tarzan hanging motionless from a vine. (b) Arrows are used to represent all forces. T is the tension exerted on Tarzan by the vine, F T is the force exerted on the vine by Tarzan, and W is Tarzan’s weight (i.e., the force exerted on Tarzan by Earth’s gravity). All other forces, such as a nudge of a breeze, are assumed to be negligible. (c) Suppose we are given Tarzan’s mass and asked to find the tension in the vine. We define the system of interest as shown and draw a free-body diagram, as shown in (d). F T is no longer shown because it does not act on the system of interest; rather, F T acts on the outside world. (d) The free-body diagram shows only the external forces acting on Tarzan. For these to sum to zero, we must have T=W . Next, make a list of knowns and unknowns and assign variable names to the quantities given in the problem. Figure out which variables need to be calculated; these are the unknowns. Now carefully define the system: which objects are of interest for the problem. This decision is important, because Newton’s second law involves only external forces. Once the system is identified, it’s possible to see which forces are external and which are internal (see ). If the system acts on an object outside the system, then you know that the outside object exerts a force of equal magnitude but in the opposite direction on the system. A diagram showing the system of interest and all the external forces acting on it is called a free-body diagram. Only external forces are shown on free-body diagrams, not acceleration or velocity. shows a free-body diagram for the system of interest. After drawing a free-body diagram, apply Newton’s second law to solve the problem. This is done in for the case of Tarzan hanging from a vine. When external forces are clearly identified in the free-body diagram, translate the forces into equation form and solve for the unknowns. Note that forces acting in opposite directions have opposite signs. By convention, forces acting downward or to the left are usually negative. If a problem has more than one system of interest, more than one free-body diagram is required to describe the external forces acting on the different systems. True False Newton’s Third Law of Motion This video explains Newton’s third law of motion through examples involving push, normal force, and thrust (the force that propels a rocket or a jet). If the astronaut in the video wanted to move upward, in which direction should he throw the object? Why? He should throw the object upward because according to Newtons third law, the object will then exert a force on him in the same direction (i.e., upward). He should throw the object upward because according to Newtons third law, the object will then exert a force on him in the opposite direction (i.e., downward). He should throw the object downward because according to Newtons third law, the object will then exert a force on him in the opposite direction (i.e., upward). He should throw the object downward because according to Newtons third law, the object will then exert a force on him in the same direction (i.e., downward). An Accelerating Equipment Cart A physics teacher pushes a cart of demonstration equipment to a classroom, as in . Her mass is 65.0 kg, the cart’s mass is 12.0 kg, and the equipment’s mass is 7.0 kg. To push the cart forward, the teacher’s foot applies a force of 150 N in the opposite direction (backward) on the floor. Calculate the acceleration produced by the teacher. The force of friction, which opposes the motion, is 24.0 N. Strategy Because they accelerate together, we define the system to be the teacher, the cart, and the equipment. The teacher pushes backward with a force F foot of 150 N. According to Newton’s third law, the floor exerts a forward force F floor of 150 N on the system. Because all motion is horizontal, we can assume that no net force acts in the vertical direction, and the problem becomes one dimensional. As noted in the figure, the friction f opposes the motion and therefore acts opposite the direction of F floor . We should not include the forces F teacher , F cart , or F foot because these are exerted by the system, not on the system. We find the net external force by adding together the external forces acting on the system (see the free-body diagram in the figure) and then use Newton’s second law to find the acceleration. Solution Newton’s second law is a = F net m . The net external force on the system is the sum of the external forces: the force of the floor acting on the teacher, cart, and equipment (in the horizontal direction) and the force of friction. Because friction acts in the opposite direction, we assign it a negative value. Thus, for the net force, we obtain F net = F floor −f =150 N−24.0 N=126 N. The mass of the system is the sum of the mass of the teacher, cart, and equipment. m = (65.0 + 12.0 + 7.0) kg = 84 kg Insert these values of net F and m into Newton’s second law to obtain the acceleration of the system. a= F net m a= 126 N 84 kg =1 .5 m/s 2 F 1 < F 2 Discussion None of the forces between components of the system, such as between the teacher’s hands and the cart, contribute to the net external force because they are internal to the system. Another way to look at this is to note that the forces between components of a system cancel because they are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. For example, the force exerted by the teacher on the cart is of equal magnitude but in the opposite direction of the force exerted by the cart on the teacher. In this case, both forces act on the same system, so they cancel. Defining the system was crucial to solving this problem. Practice Problems What is the equation for the normal force for a body with mass m that is at rest on a horizontal surface? N = m N = mg N = mv N = g An object with mass m is at rest on the floor. What is the magnitude and direction of the normal force acting on it? N = mv in upward direction N = mg in upward direction N = mv in downward direction N = mg in downward direction Section Summary Newton’s third law of motion states that when one body exerts a force on a second body, the first body experiences a force that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force that it exerts. When an object rests on a surface, the surface applies a force on the object that opposes the weight of the object. This force acts perpendicular to the surface and is called the normal force. The pulling force that acts along a stretched flexible connector, such as a rope or cable, is called tension. When a rope supports the weight of an object at rest, the tension in the rope is equal to the weight of the object. Thrust is a force that pushes an object forward in response to the backward ejection of mass by the object. Rockets and airplanes are pushed forward by thrust.

What is Newtons third law of motion? Whenever a first body exerts a force on a second body, the first body experiences a force that is twice the magnitude and acts in the direction of the applied force. Whenever a first body exerts a force on a second body, the first body experiences a force that is equal in magnitude and acts in the direction of the applied force. Whenever a first body exerts a force on a second body, the first body experiences a force that is twice the magnitude but acts in the direction opposite the direction of the applied force. Whenever a first body exerts a force on a second body, the first body experiences a force that is equal in magnitude but acts in the direction opposite the direction of the applied force. Considering Newtons third law, why dont two equal and opposite forces cancel out each other?

Rockets are more efficient in Earths atmosphere than in outer space because the air in Earths atmosphere helps to provide thrust for the rocket, and Earth has more air friction than outer space. Rockets are more efficient in Earths atmosphere than in outer space because the air in Earths atmosphere helps to provide thrust to the rocket, and Earth has less air friction than the outer space. Rockets are more efficient in outer space than in Earths atmosphere because the air in Earths atmosphere does not provide thrust but does create more air friction than in outer space. Rockets are more efficient in outer space than in Earths atmosphere because the air in Earths atmosphere does not provide thrust but does create less air friction than in outer space.

This chapter is about motion in two dimensions. Motion in two dimensions can be analyzed using vectors. We will first learn the practical skills of adding and subtracting vectors graphically (in drawings) and analytically (with math). Once we’re able to work with two-dimensional vectors, we can then apply these skills to problems of projectile motion, inclined planes, and harmonic motion. In Chapter 2, we learned to distinguish between vectors and scalars; the difference being that a vector has magnitude and direction, whereas a scalar has only magnitude and possibly sign. We learned how to deal with vectors in physics by working straightforward one-dimensional vector problems, which may be treated mathematically in the same as scalars. In this chapter, we’ll use vectors to expand our understanding of forces and motion into two dimensions. Most real-world physics problems (such as with the game of pool pictured here) are, after all, either two- or three-dimensional problems and physics is most useful when applied to real physical scenarios.

Section Key Terms graphical method head (of a vector) head-to-tail method resultant resultant vector tail vector addition vector subtraction The Graphical Method of Vector Addition and Subtraction Recall that a vector is a quantity that has magnitude and direction. For example, displacement, velocity, acceleration, and force are all vectors. In one-dimensional or straight-line motion, the direction of a vector can be given simply by a plus or minus sign. Motion that is forward, to the right, or upward is usually considered to be positive (+); and motion that is backward, to the left, or downward is usually considered to be negative (−). In two dimensions, a vector describes motion in two perpendicular directions, such as vertical and horizontal. For vertical and horizontal motion, each vector is made up of vertical and horizontal components. In a one-dimensional problem, one of the components simply has a value of zero. For two-dimensional vectors, we work with vectors by using a frame of reference such as a coordinate system. Just as with one-dimensional vectors, we graphically represent vectors with an arrow having a length proportional to the vector’s magnitude and pointing in the direction that the vector points. Teacher Support [BL][OL]Review vectors and free body diagrams. Recall how velocity, displacement and acceleration vectors are represented. shows a graphical representation of a vector; the total displacement for a person walking in a city. The person first walks nine blocks east and then five blocks north. Her total displacement does not match her path to her final destination. The displacement simply connects her starting point with her ending point using a straight line, which is the shortest distance. We use the notation that a boldface symbol, such as D, stands for a vector. Its magnitude is represented by the symbol in italics, D, and its direction is given by an angle represented by the symbol θ. Note that her displacement would be the same if she had begun by first walking five blocks north and then walking nine blocks east. In this text, we represent a vector with a boldface variable. For example, we represent a force with the vector F, which has both magnitude and direction. The magnitude of the vector is represented by the variable in italics, F, and the direction of the variable is given by the angle θ. A person walks nine blocks east and five blocks north. The displacement is 10.3 blocks at an angle 29.1 ∘ north of east. The head-to-tail method is a graphical way to add vectors. The tail of the vector is the starting point of the vector, and the head (or tip) of a vector is the pointed end of the arrow. The following steps describe how to use the head-to-tail method for graphical vector addition. Let the x-axis represent the east-west direction. Using a ruler and protractor, draw an arrow to represent the first vector (nine blocks to the east), as shown in (a). The diagram shows a vector with a magnitude of nine units and a direction of 0°. Let the y-axis represent the north-south direction. Draw an arrow to represent the second vector (five blocks to the north). Place the tail of the second vector at the head of the first vector, as shown in (b). A vertical vector is added. If there are more than two vectors, continue to add the vectors head-to-tail as described in step 2. In this example, we have only two vectors, so we have finished placing arrows tip to tail. Draw an arrow from the tail of the first vector to the head of the last vector, as shown in (c). This is the resultant, or the sum, of the vectors. The diagram shows the resultant vector, a ruler, and protractor. To find the magnitude of the resultant, measure its length with a ruler. When we deal with vectors analytically in the next section, the magnitude will be calculated by using the Pythagorean theorem. To find the direction of the resultant, use a protractor to measure the angle it makes with the reference direction (in this case, the x-axis). When we deal with vectors analytically in the next section, the direction will be calculated by using trigonometry to find the angle. Teacher Support [AL] Ask two students to demonstrate pushing a table from two different directions. Ask students what they feel the direction of resultant motion will be. How would they represent this graphically? Recall that a vector’s magnitude is represented by the length of the arrow. Demonstrate the head-to-tail method of adding vectors, using the example given in the chapter. Ask students to practice this method of addition using a scale and a protractor. [BL][OL][AL] Ask students if anything changes by moving the vector from one place to another on a graph. How about the order of addition? Would that make a difference? Introduce negative of a vector and vector subtraction. Visualizing Vector Addition Examples This video shows four graphical representations of vector addition and matches them to the correct vector addition formula. Vector subtraction is done in the same way as vector addition with one small change. We add the first vector to the negative of the vector that needs to be subtracted. A negative vector has the same magnitude as the original vector, but points in the opposite direction (as shown in ). Subtracting the vector B from the vector A, which is written as A − B, is the same as A + (−B). Since it does not matter in what order vectors are added, A − B is also equal to (−B) + A. This is true for scalars as well as vectors. For example, 5 – 2 = 5 + (−2) = (−2) + 5. The diagram shows a vector, B, and the negative of this vector, –B. Global angles are calculated in the counterclockwise direction. The clockwise direction is considered negative. For example, an angle of 30 ∘ south of west is the same as the global angle 210 ∘ , which can also be expressed as −150 ∘ from the positive x-axis. Using the Graphical Method of Vector Addition and Subtraction to Solve Physics Problems Now that we have the skills to work with vectors in two dimensions, we can apply vector addition to graphically determine the resultant vector, which represents the total force. Consider an example of force involving two ice skaters pushing a third as seen in . Part (a) shows an overhead view of two ice skaters pushing on a third. Forces are vectors and add like vectors, so the total force on the third skater is in the direction shown. In part (b), we see a free-body diagram representing the forces acting on the third skater. In problems where variables such as force are already known, the forces can be represented by making the length of the vectors proportional to the magnitudes of the forces. For this, you need to create a scale. For example, each centimeter of vector length could represent 50 N worth of force. Once you have the initial vectors drawn to scale, you can then use the head-to-tail method to draw the resultant vector. The length of the resultant can then be measured and converted back to the original units using the scale you created. You can tell by looking at the vectors in the free-body diagram in that the two skaters are pushing on the third skater with equal-magnitude forces, since the length of their force vectors are the same. Note, however, that the forces are not equal because they act in different directions. If, for example, each force had a magnitude of 400 N, then we would find the magnitude of the total external force acting on the third skater by finding the magnitude of the resultant vector. Since the forces act at a right angle to one another, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. For a triangle with sides a, b, and c, the Pythagorean theorem tells us that a 2 + b 2 = c 2 c= a 2 + b 2 . Applying this theorem to the triangle made by F1, F2, and Ftot in , we get F tot 2 = F 1 2 + F 1 2 , or F tot = (400 N) 2 + (400 N) 2 =566 N. Note that, if the vectors were not at a right angle to each other ( 90 ∘ to one another), we would not be able to use the Pythagorean theorem to find the magnitude of the resultant vector. Another scenario where adding two-dimensional vectors is necessary is for velocity, where the direction may not be purely east-west or north-south, but some combination of these two directions. In the next section, we cover how to solve this type of problem analytically. For now let’s consider the problem graphically. Adding Vectors Graphically by Using the Head-to-Tail Method: A Woman Takes a Walk Use the graphical technique for adding vectors to find the total displacement of a person who walks the following three paths (displacements) on a flat field. First, she walks 25 m in a direction 49 ∘ north of east. Then, she walks 23 m heading 15 ∘ north of east. Finally, she turns and walks 32 m in a direction 68 ∘ south of east.Strategy Graphically represent each displacement vector with an arrow, labeling the first A, the second B, and the third C. Make the lengths proportional to the distance of the given displacement and orient the arrows as specified relative to an east-west line. Use the head-to-tail method outlined above to determine the magnitude and direction of the resultant displacement, which we’ll call R. Solution (1) Draw the three displacement vectors, creating a convenient scale (such as 1 cm of vector length on paper equals 1 m in the problem), as shown in . The three displacement vectors are drawn first. (2) Place the vectors head to tail, making sure not to change their magnitude or direction, as shown in . Next, the vectors are placed head to tail. (3) Draw the resultant vector R from the tail of the first vector to the head of the last vector, as shown in . The resultant vector is drawn . (4) Use a ruler to measure the magnitude of R, remembering to convert back to the units of meters using the scale. Use a protractor to measure the direction of R. While the direction of the vector can be specified in many ways, the easiest way is to measure the angle between the vector and the nearest horizontal or vertical axis. Since R is south of the eastward pointing axis (the x-axis), we flip the protractor upside down and measure the angle between the eastward axis and the vector, as illustrated in . A ruler is used to measure the magnitude of R, and a protractor is used to measure the direction of R. In this case, the total displacement R has a magnitude of 50 m and points 7 ∘ south of east. Using its magnitude and direction, this vector can be expressed as R = 50 m and θ= 7 ∘ south of east. Discussion The head-to-tail graphical method of vector addition works for any number of vectors. It is also important to note that it does not matter in what order the vectors are added. Changing the order does not change the resultant. For example, we could add the vectors as shown in , and we would still get the same solution. Vectors can be added in any order to get the same result. Teacher Support [BL][OL][AL] Ask three students to enact the situation shown in . Recall how these forces can be represented in a free-body diagram. Giving values to these vectors, show how these can be added graphically. Subtracting Vectors Graphically: A Woman Sailing a Boat A woman sailing a boat at night is following directions to a dock. The instructions read to first sail 27.5 m in a direction 66.0 ∘ north of east from her current location, and then travel 30.0 m in a direction 112 ∘ north of east (or 22.0 ∘ west of north). If the woman makes a mistake and travels in the opposite direction for the second leg of the trip, where will she end up? The two legs of the woman’s trip are illustrated in . In the diagram, the first leg of the trip is represented by vector A and the second leg is represented by vector B. Strategy We can represent the first leg of the trip with a vector A, and the second leg of the trip that she was supposed to take with a vector B. Since the woman mistakenly travels in the opposite direction for the second leg of the journey, the vector for second leg of the trip she actually takes is −B. Therefore, she will end up at a location A + (−B), or A − B. Note that −B has the same magnitude as B (30.0 m), but is in the opposite direction, 68 ∘ ( 180 ∘ − 112 ∘ ) south of east, as illustrated in . Vector –B represents traveling in the opposite direction of vector B. We use graphical vector addition to find where the woman arrives A + (−B). Solution (1) To determine the location at which the woman arrives by accident, draw vectors A and −B. (2) Place the vectors head to tail. (3) Draw the resultant vector R. (4) Use a ruler and protractor to measure the magnitude and direction of R. These steps are demonstrated in . The vectors are placed head to tail. In this case R=23.0m and θ=7.5°south of east. Discussion Because subtraction of a vector is the same as addition of the same vector with the opposite direction, the graphical method for subtracting vectors works the same as for adding vectors. Adding Velocities: A Boat on a River A boat attempts to travel straight across a river at a speed of 3.8 m/s. The river current flows at a speed vriver of 6.1 m/s to the right. What is the total velocity and direction of the boat? You can represent each meter per second of velocity as one centimeter of vector length in your drawing. Strategy We start by choosing a coordinate system with its x-axis parallel to the velocity of the river. Because the boat is directed straight toward the other shore, its velocity is perpendicular to the velocity of the river. We draw the two vectors, vboat and vriver, as shown in . Using the head-to-tail method, we draw the resulting total velocity vector from the tail of vboat to the head of vriver. A boat attempts to travel across a river. What is the total velocity and direction of the boat? Solution By using a ruler, we find that the length of the resultant vector is 7.2 cm, which means that the magnitude of the total velocity is vtot=7.2m/s . By using a protractor to measure the angle, we find θ= 32.0 ∘ . Discussion If the velocity of the boat and river were equal, then the direction of the total velocity would have been 45°. However, since the velocity of the river is greater than that of the boat, the direction is less than 45° with respect to the shore, or x axis. Teacher Support Plot the way from the classroom to the cafeteria (or any two places in the school on the same level). Ask students to come up with approximate distances. Ask them to do a vector analysis of the path. What is the total distance travelled? What is the displacement? Practice Problems Vector Addition In this simulation, you will experiment with adding vectors graphically. Click and drag the red vectors from the Grab One basket onto the graph in the middle of the screen. These red vectors can be rotated, stretched, or repositioned by clicking and dragging with your mouse. Check the Show Sum box to display the resultant vector (in green), which is the sum of all of the red vectors placed on the graph. To remove a red vector, drag it to the trash or click the Clear All button if you wish to start over. Notice that, if you click on any of the vectors, the | R | is its magnitude, θ is its direction with respect to the positive x-axis, Rx is its horizontal component, and Ry is its vertical component. You can check the resultant by lining up the vectors so that the head of the first vector touches the tail of the second. Continue until all of the vectors are aligned together head-to-tail. You will see that the resultant magnitude and angle is the same as the arrow drawn from the tail of the first vector to the head of the last vector. Rearrange the vectors in any order head-to-tail and compare. The resultant will always be the same. True or FalseThe more long, red vectors you put on the graph, rotated in any direction, the greater the magnitude of the resultant green vector. True False Section Summary The graphical method of adding vectors A and B involves drawing vectors on a graph and adding them by using the head-to-tail method. The resultant vector R is defined such that A + B = R. The magnitude and direction of R are then determined with a ruler and protractor. The graphical method of subtracting vectors A and B involves adding the opposite of vector B, which is defined as −B. In this case, A – B = A + (–B) = R. Next, use the head-to-tail method as for vector addition to obtain the resultant vector R . Addition of vectors is independent of the order in which they are added; A + B = B + A. The head-to-tail method of adding vectors involves drawing the first vector on a graph and then placing the tail of each subsequent vector at the head of the previous vector. The resultant vector is then drawn from the tail of the first vector to the head of the final vector. Variables in physics problems, such as force or velocity, can be represented with vectors by making the length of the vector proportional to the magnitude of the force or velocity. Problems involving displacement, force, or velocity may be solved graphically by measuring the resultant vector’s magnitude with a ruler and measuring the direction with a protractor. Check Your Understanding True or FalseA person walks 2 blocks east and 5 blocks north. Another person walks 5 blocks north and then two blocks east. The displacement of the first person will be more than the displacement of the second person.

If students are struggling with a specific objective, the Check Your Understanding will help identify which objective is causing the problem and direct students to the relevant content.

Section Key Terms analytical method component (of a two-dimensional vector) Components of Vectors For the analytical method of vector addition and subtraction, we use some simple geometry and trigonometry, instead of using a ruler and protractor as we did for graphical methods. However, the graphical method will still come in handy to visualize the problem by drawing vectors using the head-to-tail method. The analytical method is more accurate than the graphical method, which is limited by the precision of the drawing. For a refresher on the definitions of the sine, cosine, and tangent of an angle, see . For a right triangle, the sine, cosine, and tangent of θ are defined in terms of the adjacent side, the opposite side, or the hypotenuse. In this figure, x is the adjacent side, y is the opposite side, and h is the hypotenuse. Teacher Support [BL][OL] Review trigonometric concepts of sine, cosine, tangent and the Pythagorean theorem. Since, by definition, cosθ=x/h, we can find the length x if we know h and θ by using x=hcosθ . Similarly, we can find the length of y by using y=hsinθ . These trigonometric relationships are useful for adding vectors.When a vector acts in more than one dimension, it is useful to break it down into its x and y components. For a two-dimensional vector, a component is a piece of a vector that points in either the x- or y-direction. Every 2-d vector can be expressed as a sum of its x and y components. For example, given a vector like A in , we may want to find what two perpendicular vectors, A x and A y , add to produce it. In this example, A x and A y form a right triangle, meaning that the angle between them is 90 degrees. This is a common situation in physics and happens to be the least complicated situation trigonometrically. The vector A , with its tail at the origin of an x- y-coordinate system, is shown together with its x- and y-components, A x and A y . These vectors form a right triangle. A x and A y are defined to be the components of A along the x- and y-axes. The three vectors, A , A x , and A y , form a right triangle. A x + A y = A If the vector A is known, then its magnitude A (its length) and its angle θ (its direction) are known. To find A x and A y , its x- and y-components, we use the following relationships for a right triangle: A x =Acosθ and A y =Asinθ, where A x is the magnitude of A in the x-direction, A y is the magnitude of A in the y-direction, and θ is the angle of the resultant with respect to the x-axis, as shown in . The magnitudes of the vector components A x and A y can be related to the resultant vector A and the angle θ with trigonometric identities. Here we see that A x =Acosθ and A y =Asinθ. Teacher Support [BL][OL][AL] Derive the formula for getting the magnitude and direction of a vector. Students might be confused between the relationship A x + A y = A , which shows the addition of vectors and A= A x 2 + A y 2 which shows the addition of magnitudes of vectors. Suppose, for example, that A is the vector representing the total displacement of the person walking in a city, as illustrated in . We can use the relationships A x =Acosθ and A y =Asinθ to determine the magnitude of the horizontal and vertical component vectors in this example.Then A = 10.3 blocks and θ= 29.1 ∘ , so that A x = Acosθ = (10.3 blocks)(cos29 .1 ∘ ) = (10.3 blocks)(0.874) = 9.0 blocks. This magnitude indicates that the walker has traveled 9 blocks to the east—in other words, a 9-block eastward displacement. Similarly, A y = Asinθ = (10.3 blocks)(sin29 .1 ∘ ) = (10.3 blocks)(0.846) = 5.0 blocks, indicating that the walker has traveled 5 blocks to the north—a 5-block northward displacement. Analytical Method of Vector Addition and Subtraction Calculating a resultant vector (or vector addition) is the reverse of breaking the resultant down into its components. If the perpendicular components A x and A y of a vector A are known, then we can find A analytically. How do we do this? Since, by definition, tanθ=y/x (or in this case tanθ= A y / A x ), we solve for θ to find the direction of the resultant. θ= tan −1 ( A y / A x ) Note that tan −1 (θ) gives an angle in the first quadrant if Ay/Ax>0 and in the fourth quadrant if Ay/Ax<0 . If, in fact, both Ax and Ay are negative, or if Ax is negative and Ay positive, then θ, measured from the positive x direction, is tan –1 (θ)+180° . Since this is a right triangle, the Pythagorean theorem (x2 + y2 = h2) for finding the hypotenuse applies. In this case, it becomes A 2 = A x 2 + A y 2 . Solving for A gives A= A x 2 + A y 2 . In summary, to find the magnitude A and direction θ of a vector from its perpendicular components A x and A y , as illustrated in , we use the following relationships: A = A x 2 + A y 2 θ= tan −1 ( A y / A x ) The magnitude and direction of the resultant vector A can be determined once the horizontal components A x and A y have been determined. Teacher Support [BL][OL][AL] Demonstrate a problem involving displacement by physically walking along the specified direction. Show how this can be represented on a graph. Explain that even when solving problems analytically; representing it on a graph would make it easier to visualize the problem. Sometimes, the vectors added are not perfectly perpendicular to one another. An example of this is the case below, where the vectors A and B are added to produce the resultant R , as illustrated in . Vectors A and B are two legs of a walk, and R is the resultant or total displacement. You can use analytical methods to determine the magnitude and direction of R . If A and B represent two legs of a walk (two displacements), then R is the total displacement. The person taking the walk ends up at the tip of R . There are many ways to arrive at the same point. The person could have walked straight ahead first in the x-direction and then in the y-direction. Those paths are the x- and y-components of the resultant, R x and R y . If we know R x and R y , we can find R and θ using the equations R= R x 2 + R y 2 and θ=ta n –1 ( R y / R x ) . Draw in the x and y components of each vector (including the resultant) with a dashed line. Use the equations A x =Acosθ and A y =Asinθ to find the components. In , these components are A x , A y , B x , and B y . Vector A makes an angle of θ A with the x-axis, and vector B makes and angle of θ B with its own x-axis (which is slightly above the x-axis used by vector A). To add vectors A and B, first determine the horizontal and vertical components of each vector. These are the dotted vectors A x , A y B y shown in the image. Find the x component of the resultant by adding the x component of the vectors R x = A x + B x and find the y component of the resultant (as illustrated in ) by adding the y component of the vectors. R y = A y + B y . The vectors A x and B x add to give the magnitude of the resultant vector in the horizontal direction, R x . Similarly, the vectors A y and B y add to give the magnitude of the resultant vector in the vertical direction, R y . Now that we know the components of R, we can find its magnitude and direction. To get the magnitude of the resultant R, use the Pythagorean theorem. R= R x 2 + R y 2 To get the direction of the resultant θ= tan −1 ( R y / R x ). Classifying Vectors and Quantities Example This video contrasts and compares three vectors in terms of their magnitudes, positions, and directions. In the video, the vectors were represented with an arrow above them rather than in bold. This is a common notation in math classes. Using the Analytical Method of Vector Addition and Subtraction to Solve Problems uses the analytical method to add vectors. An Accelerating Subway Train Add the vector A to the vector B shown in , using the steps above. The x-axis is along the east–west direction, and the y-axis is along the north–south directions. A person first walks 53.0 m in a direction 20.0° north of east, represented by vector A. The person then walks 34.0 m in a direction 63.0° north of east, represented by vector B. You can use analytical models to add vectors. Strategy The components of A and B along the x- and y-axes represent walking due east and due north to get to the same ending point. We will solve for these components and then add them in the x-direction and y-direction to find the resultant. Solution First, we find the components of A and B along the x- and y-axes. From the problem, we know that A=53.0 m, θ A = 20.0 ∘, B = 34.0 m , and θ B = 63.0 ∘ . We find the x-components by using A x =Acosθ , which gives A x = Acos θ A =(53.0 m)(cos 20.0 ∘ ) = (53.0 m)(0.940)=49.8 m and B x = Bcos θ B =(34.0 m)(cos 63.0 ∘ ) = (34.0 m)(0.454)=15.4 m. Similarly, the y-components are found using A y =Asin θ A A y = Asin θ A =(53.0 m)(sin 20.0 ∘ ) = (53.0 m)(0.342)=18.1 m and B y = Bsin θ B =(34.0 m)(sin 63.0 ∘ ) = (34.0 m)(0.891)=30.3 m. The x- and y-components of the resultant are R x = A x + B x =49.8 m+15.4 m=65.2 m and R y = A y + B y =18.1 m+30.3 m=48.4 m. Now we can find the magnitude of the resultant by using the Pythagorean theorem R= R x 2 + R y 2 = (65.2) 2 + (48.4) 2 m so that R= 6601 m =81.2 m . Finally, we find the direction of the resultant θ= tan −1 ( R y / R x )=+ tan −1 (48.4/65.2). This is θ= tan −1 (0.742)= 36.6 ∘ . Discussion This example shows vector addition using the analytical method. Vector subtraction using the analytical method is very similar. It is just the addition of a negative vector. That is, A−B≡A+(−B) . The components of – B are the negatives of the components of B . Therefore, the x- and y-components of the resultant A−B=R are R x = A x +- B x and R y = A y +- B y and the rest of the method outlined above is identical to that for addition.

(BBC TV)Atmospheric science is a physical science, meaning that it is a science based heavily on physics. Atmospheric science includes meteorology (the study of weather) and climatology (the study of climate). Climate is basically the average weather over a longer time scale. Weather changes quickly over time, whereas the climate changes more gradually. The movement of air, water and heat is vitally important to climatology and meteorology. Since motion is such a major factor in weather and climate, this field uses vectors for much of its math. Vectors are used to represent currents in the ocean, wind velocity and forces acting on a parcel of air. You have probably seen a weather map using vectors to show the strength (magnitude) and direction of the wind. Vectors used in atmospheric science are often three-dimensional. We won’t cover three-dimensional motion in this text, but to go from two-dimensions to three-dimensions, you simply add a third vector component. Three-dimensional motion is represented as a combination of x-, y- and z components, where z is the altitude. Vector calculus combines vector math with calculus, and is often used to find the rates of change in temperature, pressure or wind speed over time or distance. This is useful information, since atmospheric motion is driven by changes in pressure or temperature. The greater the variation in pressure over a given distance, the stronger the wind to try to correct that imbalance. Cold air tends to be more dense and therefore has higher pressure than warm air. Higher pressure air rushes into a region of lower pressure and gets deflected by the spinning of the Earth, and friction slows the wind at Earth’s surface. Finding how wind changes over distance and multiplying vectors lets meteorologists, like the one shown in , figure out how much rotation (spin) there is in the atmosphere at any given time and location. This is an important tool for tornado prediction. Conditions with greater rotation are more likely to produce tornadoes. Section Summary The analytical method of vector addition and subtraction uses the Pythagorean theorem and trigonometric identities to determine the magnitude and direction of a resultant vector. The steps to add vectors A and B using the analytical method are as follows: Determine the coordinate system for the vectors. Then, determine the horizontal and vertical components of each vector using the equations A x = Acosθ B x = Bcosθ and A y = Asinθ B y = Bsinθ . Add the horizontal and vertical components of each vector to determine the components R x and R y of the resultant vector, R. R x = A x + B x and R y = A y + B y .

Section Key Terms air resistance maximum height (of a projectile) projectile projectile motion range trajectory Properties of Projectile Motion Projectile motion is the motion of an object thrown (projected) into the air when, after the initial force that launches the object, air resistance is negligible and the only other force that object experiences is the force of gravity. The object is called a projectile, and its path is called its trajectory. Air resistance is a frictional force that slows its motion and can significantly alter the trajectory of the motion. Due to the difficulty in calculation, only situations in which the deviation from projectile motion is negligible and air resistance can be ignored are considered in introductory physics. That approximation is often quite accurate. Teacher Support [BL][OL] Review addition of vectors graphically and analytically. [BL][OL][AL] Explain the term projectile motion. Ask students to guess what the motion of a projectile might depend on? Is the initial velocity important? Is the angle important? How will these things affect its height and the distance it covers? Introduce the concept of air resistance. Review kinematic equations. The most important concept in projectile motion is that when air resistance is ignored, horizontal and vertical motions are independent, meaning that they don’t influence one another. compares a cannonball in free fall (in blue) to a cannonball launched horizontally in projectile motion (in red). You can see that the cannonball in free fall falls at the same rate as the cannonball in projectile motion. Keep in mind that if the cannon launched the ball with any vertical component to the velocity, the vertical displacements would not line up perfectly. Since vertical and horizontal motions are independent, we can analyze them separately, along perpendicular axes. To do this, we separate projectile motion into the two components of its motion, one along the horizontal axis and the other along the vertical. The diagram shows the projectile motion of a cannonball shot at a horizontal angle versus one dropped with no horizontal velocity. Note that both cannonballs have the same vertical position over time. We’ll call the horizontal axis the x-axis and the vertical axis the y-axis. For notation, d is the total displacement, and x and y are its components along the horizontal and vertical axes. The magnitudes of these vectors are x and y, as illustrated in . A boy kicks a ball at angle θ, and it is displaced a distance of s along its trajectory. As usual, we use velocity, acceleration, and displacement to describe motion. We must also find the components of these variables along the x- and y-axes. The components of acceleration are then very simple ay = –g = –9.80 m/s2. Note that this definition defines the upwards direction as positive. Because gravity is vertical, ax = 0. Both accelerations are constant, so we can use the kinematic equations. For review, the kinematic equations from a previous chapter are summarized in .Summary of Kinematic Equations (constant a) x= x 0 + v avg t (when a=constant ) v avg = v 0 +v 2 (when a=0 ) v= v 0 +at x= x 0 + v 0 t+ 1 2 a t 2 v 2 = v 0 2 +2a(x− x 0 ) Where x is position, x0 is initial position, v is velocity, vavg is average velocity, t is time and a is acceleration. Solve Problems Involving Projectile Motion The following steps are used to analyze projectile motion: Separate the motion into horizontal and vertical components along the x- and y-axes. These axes are perpendicular, so A x =Acosθ and A y =Asinθ are used. The magnitudes of the displacement s along x- and y-axes are called x and y. The magnitudes of the components of the velocity v are v x =v​​​cosθ and v y =v​​​sinθ , where v is the magnitude of the velocity and θ is its direction. Initial values are denoted with a subscript 0. Treat the motion as two independent one-dimensional motions, one horizontal and the other vertical. The kinematic equations for horizontal and vertical motion take the following forms Horizontal Motion( a x =0) x= x 0 + v x t v x = v 0x = v x =velocity is a constant. Vertical motion (assuming positive is up a y =−g=−9.80 m/s 2 ) y = y 0 + 1 2 ( v 0y + v y )t v y = v 0y −gt y = y 0 + v 0y t− 1 2 g t 2 v y 2 = v 0y 2 −2g(y− y 0 ) Solve for the unknowns in the two separate motions (one horizontal and one vertical). Note that the only common variable between the motions is time t . The problem solving procedures here are the same as for one-dimensional kinematics. Recombine the two motions to find the total displacement s and velocity v . We can use the analytical method of vector addition, which uses A= A x 2 + A y 2 and θ= tan −1 ( A y / A x ) to find the magnitude and direction of the total displacement and velocity. Displacement d= x 2 + y 2 θ= tan −1 (y/x) Velocity v= v x 2 + v y 2 θ v = tan −1 ( v y / v x ) θ is the direction of the displacement d , and θ v is the direction of the velocity v . (See (a) We analyze two-dimensional projectile motion by breaking it into two independent one-dimensional motions along the vertical and horizontal axes. (b) The horizontal motion is simple, because a x =0 and v x is thus constant. (c) The velocity in the vertical direction begins to decrease as the object rises; at its highest point, the vertical velocity is zero. As the object falls towards the Earth again, the vertical velocity increases again in magnitude but points in the opposite direction to the initial vertical velocity. (d) The x- and y-motions are recombined to give the total velocity at any given point on the trajectory. Teacher Support Demonstrate the path of a projectile by doing a simple demonstration. Toss a dark beanbag in front of a white board so that students can get a good look at the projectile path. Vary the toss angles, so different paths can be displayed. This demonstration could be extended by using digital photography. Draw a reference grid on the whiteboard, then toss the bag at different angles while taking a video. Replay this in slow motion to observe and compare the altitudes and trajectories. For problems of projectile motion, it is important to set up a coordinate system. The first step is to choose an initial position for x and y . Usually, it is simplest to set the initial position of the object so that x 0 =0 and y 0 =0 . Projectile at an Angle This video presents an example of finding the displacement (or range) of a projectile launched at an angle. It also reviews basic trigonometry for finding the sine, cosine and tangent of an angle. A Fireworks Projectile Explodes High and Away During a fireworks display like the one illustrated in , a shell is shot into the air with an initial speed of 70.0 m/s at an angle of 75° above the horizontal. The fuse is timed to ignite the shell just as it reaches its highest point above the ground. (a) Calculate the height at which the shell explodes. (b) How much time passed between the launch of the shell and the explosion? (c) What is the horizontal displacement of the shell when it explodes? The diagram shows the trajectory of a fireworks shell. Strategy The motion can be broken into horizontal and vertical motions in which a x =0 and a y =g . We can then define x 0 and y 0 to be zero and solve for the maximum height. Solution for (a) By height we mean the altitude or vertical position y above the starting point. The highest point in any trajectory, the maximum height, is reached when v y =0 ; this is the moment when the vertical velocity switches from positive (upwards) to negative (downwards). Since we know the initial velocity, initial position, and the value of vy when the firework reaches its maximum height, we use the following equation to find y v y 2 = v 0y 2 −2g(y− y 0 ). Because y 0 and v y are both zero, the equation simplifies to 0= v 0y 2 −2gy. Solving for y gives y= v 0y 2 2g . Now we must find v 0y , the component of the initial velocity in the y-direction. It is given by v 0y = v 0 sinθ , where v 0 is the initial velocity of 70.0 m/s, and θ= 75 ∘ is the initial angle. Thus, v 0y = v 0 sin θ 0 =(70.0 m/s)(sin 75 ∘ )=67.6 m/s and y is y= (67.6 m/s) 2 2(9.80 m/s 2 ), so that y=233 m. Discussion for (a) Since up is positive, the initial velocity and maximum height are positive, but the acceleration due to gravity is negative. The maximum height depends only on the vertical component of the initial velocity. The numbers in this example are reasonable for large fireworks displays, the shells of which do reach such heights before exploding. Solution for (b) There is more than one way to solve for the time to the highest point. In this case, the easiest method is to use y= y 0 + 1 2 ( v 0y + v y )t . Because y 0 is zero, this equation reduces to y= 1 2 ( v 0y + v y )t . Note that the final vertical velocity, v y , at the highest point is zero. Therefore, t = 2y ( v 0y + v y ) = 2(233 m) (67.6 m/s) = 6.90 s. Discussion for (b) This time is also reasonable for large fireworks. When you are able to see the launch of fireworks, you will notice several seconds pass before the shell explodes. Another way of finding the time is by using y= y 0 + v 0y t− 1 2 g t 2 , and solving the quadratic equation for t . Solution for (c) Because air resistance is negligible, a x =0 and the horizontal velocity is constant. The horizontal displacement is horizontal velocity multiplied by time as given by x= x 0 + v x t , where x 0 is equal to zero x= v x t, where v x is the x-component of the velocity, which is given by v x = v 0 cos θ 0 . Now, v x = v 0 cos θ 0 =(70.0 m/s)(cos 75 ∘ )=18.1 m/s. The time t for both motions is the same, and so x is x=(18.1 m/s)(6.90 s)=125 m. Discussion for (c) The horizontal motion is a constant velocity in the absence of air resistance. The horizontal displacement found here could be useful in keeping the fireworks fragments from falling on spectators. Once the shell explodes, air resistance has a major effect, and many fragments will land directly below, while some of the fragments may now have a velocity in the –x direction due to the forces of the explosion. Teacher Support [BL][OL][AL] Talk about the sample problem. Discuss the variables or unknowns in each part of the problem Ask students which kinematic equations may be best suited to solve the different parts of the problem. The expression we found for y while solving part (a) of the previous problem works for any projectile motion problem where air resistance is negligible. Call the maximum height y=h ; then, h= v 0y 2 2g . This equation defines the maximum height of a projectile. The maximum height depends only on the vertical component of the initial velocity. Calculating Projectile Motion: Hot Rock Projectile Suppose a large rock is ejected from a volcano, as illustrated in , with a speed of 25.0 m/s and at an angle 35° above the horizontal. The rock strikes the side of the volcano at an altitude 20.0 m lower than its starting point. (a) Calculate the time it takes the rock to follow this path. The diagram shows the projectile motion of a large rock from a volcano.Strategy Breaking this two-dimensional motion into two independent one-dimensional motions will allow us to solve for the time. The time a projectile is in the air depends only on its vertical motion. Solution While the rock is in the air, it rises and then falls to a final position 20.0 m lower than its starting altitude. We can find the time for this by using y= y 0 + v 0y t− 1 2 g t 2 . If we take the initial position y 0 to be zero, then the final position is y=−20.0 m. Now the initial vertical velocity is the vertical component of the initial velocity, found from v 0 y = v 0 sin θ 0 =(25.0 m/s)(sin 35 ∘ )=14.3 m/s. Substituting known values yields −20.0 m=(14.3 m/s)t−( 4.90 m/s 2 ) t 2 . Rearranging terms gives a quadratic equation in t ( 4.90 m/s 2 ) t 2 −( 14.3 m/s )t−( 20.0 m )=0 . This expression is a quadratic equation of the form a t 2 +bt+c=0 , where the constants are a = 4.90, b = –14.3, and c = –20.0. Its solutions are given by the quadratic formula t= −b± b 2 −4ac 2a . This equation yields two solutions t = 3.96 and t = –1.03. You may verify these solutions as an exercise. The time is t = 3.96 s or –1.03 s. The negative value of time implies an event before the start of motion, so we discard it. Therefore, t=3.96 s. Discussion The time for projectile motion is completely determined by the vertical motion. So any projectile that has an initial vertical velocity of 14.3m/s and lands 20.0 m below its starting altitude will spend 3.96 s in the air. Practice Problems The fact that vertical and horizontal motions are independent of each other lets us predict the range of a projectile. The range is the horizontal distance R traveled by a projectile on level ground, as illustrated in . Throughout history, people have been interested in finding the range of projectiles for practical purposes, such as aiming cannons. Trajectories of projectiles on level ground. (a) The greater the initial speed v 0 , the greater the range for a given initial angle. (b) The effect of initial angle θ 0 on the range of a projectile with a given initial speed. Note that any combination of trajectories that add to 90 degrees will have the same range in the absence of air resistance, although the maximum heights of those paths are different. How does the initial velocity of a projectile affect its range? Obviously, the greater the initial speed v 0 , the greater the range, as shown in the figure above. The initial angle θ 0 also has a dramatic effect on the range. When air resistance is negligible, the range R of a projectile on level ground is R= v 0 2 sin2 θ 0 g , where v 0 is the initial speed and θ 0 is the initial angle relative to the horizontal. It is important to note that the range doesn’t apply to problems where the initial and final y position are different, or to cases where the object is launched perfectly horizontally. Projectile Motion In this simulation you will learn about projectile motion by blasting objects out of a cannon. You can choose between objects such as a tank shell, a golf ball or even a Buick. Experiment with changing the angle, initial speed, and mass, and adding in air resistance. Make a game out of this simulation by trying to hit the target. Section Summary Projectile motion is the motion of an object through the air that is subject only to the acceleration of gravity. Projectile motion in the horizontal and vertical directions are independent of one another. The maximum height of an projectile is the highest altitude, or maximum displacement in the vertical position reached in the path of a projectile. The range is the maximum horizontal distance traveled by a projectile. To solve projectile problems: choose a coordinate system; analyze the motion in the vertical and horizontal direction separately; then, recombine the horizontal and vertical components using vector addition equations.

The student knows and applies the laws governing motion in two dimensions for a variety of situations. The student is expected to: (D) calculate the effect of forces on objects, including the law of inertia, the relationship between force and acceleration, and the nature of force pairs between objects. Section Key Terms kinetic friction static friction Static Friction and Kinetic Friction Recall from the previous chapter that friction is a force that opposes relative motion parallel to the contact surface of the interacting objects and is around us all the time. Friction allows us to move, which you have discovered if you have ever tried to walk on ice. There are different types of friction—kinetic and static. Kinetic friction acts on an object in relative motion, while static friction acts on an object or system at rest relative to each other. The maximum static friction is usually greater than the kinetic friction between the objects. Teacher Support [BL][OL] Review the concept of friction. [AL] Start a discussion about the two kinds of friction: static and kinetic. Ask students which one they think would be greater for two given surfaces. Explain the concept of coefficient of friction and what the number would imply in practical terms. Look at the table of static and kinetic friction and ask students to guess which other systems would have higher or lower coefficients. Imagine, for example, trying to slide a heavy crate across a concrete floor. You may push harder and harder on the crate and not move it at all. This means that the static friction responds to what you do—it increases to be equal to and in the opposite direction of your push. But if you finally push hard enough, the crate seems to slip suddenly and starts to move. Once in motion, it is easier to keep it in motion than it was to get it started because the kinetic friction force is less than the static friction force. If you were to add mass to the crate, (for example, by placing a box on top of it) you would need to push even harder to get it started and also to keep it moving. If, on the other hand, you oiled the concrete you would find it easier to get the crate started and keep it going. shows how friction occurs at the interface between two objects. Magnifying these surfaces shows that they are rough on the microscopic level. So when you push to get an object moving (in this case, a crate), you must raise the object until it can skip along with just the tips of the surface hitting, break off the points, or do both. The harder the surfaces are pushed together (such as if another box is placed on the crate), the more force is needed to move them. Frictional forces, such as f, always oppose motion or attempted motion between objects in contact. Friction arises in part because of the roughness of the surfaces in contact, as seen in the expanded view.The magnitude of the frictional force has two forms: one for static friction, the other for kinetic friction. When there is no motion between the objects, the magnitude of static friction fs is f s ≤ μ s N , where μ s is the coefficient of static friction and N is the magnitude of the normal force. Recall that the normal force acts perpendicular to the surface and prevents the crate from falling through the floor. It opposes the force of gravity in this example, but that will not always be the case.Since the symbol ≤ means less than or equal to, this equation says that static friction can have a maximum value of μ s N. That is, f s (max)= μ s N. Static friction is a responsive force that increases to be equal and opposite to whatever force is exerted, up to its maximum limit. Once the applied force exceeds fs(max), the object will move. Once an object is moving, the magnitude of kinetic friction fk is given by f k = μ k N. where μ k is the coefficient of kinetic friction.Friction varies from surface to surface because different substances are rougher than others. compares values of static and kinetic friction for different surfaces. The coefficient of the friction depends on the two surfaces that are in contact. Coefficients of Static and Kinetic Friction System Static Friction μ s Kinetic Friction μ k Rubber on dry concrete 1.0 0.7 Rubber on wet concrete 0.7 0.5 Wood on wood 0.5 0.3 Waxed wood on wet snow 0.14 0.1 Metal on wood 0.5 0.3 Steel on steel (dry) 0.6 0.3 Steel on steel (oiled) 0.05 0.03 Teflon on steel 0.04 0.04 Bone lubricated by synovial fluid 0.016 0.015 Shoes on wood 0.9 0.7 Shoes on ice 0.1 0.05 Ice on ice 0.1 0.03 Steel on ice 0.4 0.02 Since friction always opposes relative motion, the direction of friction is upward along the plane if the object is at rest or sliding down the incline. For example, if the crate you try to push (with a force parallel to the floor) has a mass of 100 kg, then the normal force would be equal to its weight W=mg=(100kg)(9.80 m/s 2 )=980 N, perpendicular to the floor. If the coefficient of static friction is 0.45, you would have to exert a force parallel to the floor greater than f s (max)= μ s N=(0.45)(980 N)=440 N to move the crate. Once there is motion, friction is less and the coefficient of kinetic friction might be 0.30, so that a force of only 290 N f k = μ k N=(0.30)(980 N)=290 N would keep it moving at a constant speed. If the floor were lubricated, both coefficients would be much smaller than they would be without lubrication. The coefficient of friction is unitless and is a number usually between 0 and 1.0, but there is no theoretical upper limit to its value. Working with Inclined PlanesWe discussed previously that when an object rests on a horizontal surface, there is a normal force supporting it equal in magnitude to its weight. Up until now, we dealt only with normal force in one dimension, with gravity and normal force acting perpendicular to the surface in opposing directions (gravity downward, and normal force upward). Now that you have the skills to work with forces in two dimensions, we can explore what happens to weight and the normal force on a tilted surface such as an inclined plane. For inclined plane problems, it is easier breaking down the forces into their components if we rotate the coordinate system, as illustrated in . The first step when setting up the problem is to break down the force of weight into components. The diagram shows perpendicular and horizontal components of weight on an inclined plane. Teacher Support [BL] Review the concepts of mass, weight, gravitation and normal force. [OL] Review vectors and components of vectors. When an object rests on an incline that makes an angle θ with the horizontal, the force of gravity acting on the object is divided into two components: A force acting perpendicular to the plane, w ⊥ , and a force acting parallel to the plane, w || . The perpendicular force of weight, w ⊥ , is typically equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the normal force, N. The force acting parallel to the plane, w || , causes the object to accelerate down the incline. The force of friction, f , opposes the motion of the object, so it acts upward along the plane.It is important to be careful when resolving the weight of the object into components. If the angle of the incline is at an angle θ to the horizontal, then the magnitudes of the weight components are w || =wsin(θ)=mgsin(θ) and w ⊥ =wcos(θ)=mgcos(θ). Instead of memorizing these equations, it is helpful to be able to determine them from reason. To do this, draw the right triangle formed by the three weight vectors. Notice that the angle of the incline is the same as the angle formed between w and w ⊥ . Knowing this property, you can use trigonometry to determine the magnitude of the weight components cos(θ)= w ⊥ w w ⊥ =wcos(θ)=mgcos(θ) sin(θ)= w || w w || =wsin(θ)=mgsin(θ). Teacher Support [BL][OL][AL] Experiment with sliding different objects on inclined planes to understand static and kinetic friction. Which objects need a larger angle to slide down? What does this say about the coefficients of friction of those systems? Is a greater force required to start the motion of an object than to keep it in motion? What does this say about static and kinetic friction? When does an object slide down at constant velocity? What does this say about friction and normal force? Inclined Plane Force Components This video shows how the weight of an object on an inclined plane is broken down into components perpendicular and parallel to the surface of the plane. It explains the geometry for finding the angle in more detail. Normal force is represented by the variable N. This should not be confused with the symbol for the newton, which is also represented by the letter N. It is important to tell apart these symbols, especially since the units for normal force ( N ) happen to be newtons (N). For example, the normal force, N , that the floor exerts on a chair might be N=100 N. One important difference is that normal force is a vector, while the newton is simply a unit. Be careful not to confuse these letters in your calculations! To review, the process for solving inclined plane problems is as follows: Draw a sketch of the problem. Identify known and unknown quantities, and identify the system of interest. Draw a free-body diagram (which is a sketch showing all of the forces acting on an object) with the coordinate system rotated at the same angle as the inclined plane. Resolve the vectors into horizontal and vertical components and draw them on the free-body diagram. Write Newton’s second law in the horizontal and vertical directions and add the forces acting on the object. If the object does not accelerate in a particular direction (for example, the x -direction) then Fnet x = 0. If the object does accelerate in that direction, Fnet x = ma. Check your answer. Is the answer reasonable? Are the units correct? Finding the Coefficient of Kinetic Friction on an Inclined Plane A skier, illustrated in (a), with a mass of 62 kg is sliding down a snowy slope at an angle of 25 degrees. Find the coefficient of kinetic friction for the skier if friction is known to be 45.0 N. Use the diagram to help find the coefficient of kinetic friction for the skier. Strategy The magnitude of kinetic friction was given as 45.0 N. Kinetic friction is related to the normal force N as f k = μ k N . Therefore, we can find the coefficient of kinetic friction by first finding the normal force of the skier on a slope. The normal force is always perpendicular to the surface, and since there is no motion perpendicular to the surface, the normal force should equal the component of the skier’s weight perpendicular to the slope.That is, N= w ⊥ =w cos( 25 ∘ )=mg cos( 25 ∘ ) . Substituting this into our expression for kinetic friction, we get f k = μ k mg cos 25 ∘ , which can now be solved for the coefficient of kinetic friction μk. Solution Solving for μ k gives μ k = f k w cos 25 ∘ = f k mg cos 25 ∘ . Substituting known values on the right-hand side of the equation, μ k = 45.0 N (62 kg)(9 .80 m/s 2 )(0.906) =0.082 . Discussion This result is a little smaller than the coefficient listed in for waxed wood on snow, but it is still reasonable since values of the coefficients of friction can vary greatly. In situations like this, where an object of mass m slides down a slope that makes an angle θ with the horizontal, friction is given by f k = μ k mg cosθ. Weight on an Incline, a Two-Dimensional Problem The skier’s mass, including equipment, is 60.0 kg. (See (b).) (a) What is her acceleration if friction is negligible? (b) What is her acceleration if the frictional force is 45.0 N? Now use the diagram to help find the skier's acceleration if friction is negligible and if the frictional force is 45.0 N. Strategy The most convenient coordinate system for motion on an incline is one that has one coordinate parallel to the slope and one perpendicular to the slope. Remember that motions along perpendicular axes are independent. We use the symbol ⊥ to mean perpendicular, and || to mean parallel. The only external forces acting on the system are the skier’s weight, friction, and the normal force exerted by the ski slope, labeled w , f , and N in the free-body diagram. N is always perpendicular to the slope and f is parallel to it. But w is not in the direction of either axis, so we must break it down into components along the chosen axes. We define w || to be the component of weight parallel to the slope and w ⊥ the component of weight perpendicular to the slope. Once this is done, we can consider the two separate problems of forces parallel to the slope and forces perpendicular to the slope. Solution The magnitude of the component of the weight parallel to the slope is w || =wsin(25°)=mgsin(25°) , and the magnitude of the component of the weight perpendicular to the slope is w ⊥ =wcos(25°)=mgcos(25°). (a) Neglecting friction: Since the acceleration is parallel to the slope, we only need to consider forces parallel to the slope. Forces perpendicular to the slope add to zero, since there is no acceleration in that direction. The forces parallel to the slope are the amount of the skier’s weight parallel to the slope w || and friction f . Assuming no friction, by Newton’s second law the acceleration parallel to the slope is a || = F net || m , Where the net force parallel to the slope F net || = w || =mgsin(25°) , so that a || = F net || m = mgsin(25°) m =gsin(25°) = (9.80 m/s 2 )(0.423)=4.14 m/s 2 is the acceleration. (b) Including friction: Here we now have a given value for friction, and we know its direction is parallel to the slope and it opposes motion between surfaces in contact. So the net external force is now F net || = w || −f, and substituting this into Newton’s second law, a || = F net || m gives a || = F net || m = w || −f m = mgsin(25°)−f m . We substitute known values to get a || = (60.0 kg)(9 .80 m/s 2 )(0.423)−45.0 N 60.0 kg , or a || =3 .39 m/s 2 , which is the acceleration parallel to the incline when there is 45 N opposing friction. Discussion Since friction always opposes motion between surfaces, the acceleration is smaller when there is friction than when there is not. Practice Problems When an object sits on an inclined plane that makes an angle θ with the horizontal, what is the expression for the component of the objects weight force that is parallel to the incline? w||=wcosθ w||=wsinθ w||=wsinθ−cosθ w||=wcosθ−sinθ Friction at an Angle: Sliding a Coin An object will slide down an inclined plane at a constant velocity if the net force on the object is zero. We can use this fact to measure the coefficient of kinetic friction between two objects. As shown in the first Worked Example, the kinetic friction on a slope f k = μ k mg cosθ , and the component of the weight down the slope is equal to mg sinθ . These forces act in opposite directions, so when they have equal magnitude, the acceleration is zero. Writing these out f k = F g x μ k mg cosθ = mg sinθ. Solving for μ k , since tanθ=sinθ/cosθ we find that μ k = mg sinθ mg cosθ = tanθ. 1 coin 1 book 1 protractor Put a coin flat on a book and tilt it until the coin slides at a constant velocity down the book. You might need to tap the book lightly to get the coin to move. Measure the angle of tilt relative to the horizontal and find μ k . True or FalseIf only the angles of two vectors are known, we can find the angle of their resultant addition vector. True False Section Summary Friction is a contact force between systems that opposes the motion or attempted motion between them. Simple friction is proportional to the normal force N pushing the systems together. A normal force is always perpendicular to the contact surface between systems. Friction depends on both of the materials involved. µs is the coefficient of static friction, which depends on both of the materials. µk is the coefficient of kinetic friction, which also depends on both materials. When objects rest on an inclined plane that makes an angle θ with the horizontal surface, the weight of the object can be broken into components that act perpendicular ( w ⊥ ) and parallel ( w || ) to the surface of the plane. Key Equations force of static friction f s ≤ μ s N force of kinetic friction f k = μ k N perpendicular component of weight on an inclined plane w ⊥ =wcos(θ)=mgcos(θ) parallel component of weight on an inclined plane w || =wsin(θ)=mgsin(θ) Check Your Understanding Teacher Support Use the Check Your Understanding questions to assess whether students achieve the learning objectives for this section. If students are struggling with a specific objective, the Check Your Understanding will help identify which objective is causing the problem and direct students to the relevant content. Concept Items True or FalseKinetic friction is less than the limiting static friction because once an object is moving, there are fewer points of contact, and the friction is reduced. For this reason, more force is needed to start moving an object than to keep it in motion. True False Problems A skier with a mass of 55 kg is skiing down a snowy slope that has an incline of 30°.

Section Key Terms amplitude deformation equilibrium position frequency Hooke’s law oscillate period periodic motion restoring force simple harmonic motion simple pendulum Hooke’s Law and Simple Harmonic Motion Imagine a car parked against a wall. If a bulldozer pushes the car into the wall, the car will not move but it will noticeably change shape. A change in shape due to the application of a force is a deformation. Even very small forces are known to cause some deformation. For small deformations, two important things can happen. First, unlike the car and bulldozer example, the object returns to its original shape when the force is removed. Second, the size of the deformation is proportional to the force. This second property is known as Hooke’s law. In equation form, Hooke’s law is F=−kx, where x is the amount of deformation (the change in length, for example) produced by the restoring force F, and k is a constant that depends on the shape and composition of the object. The restoring force is the force that brings the object back to its equilibrium position; the minus sign is there because the restoring force acts in the direction opposite to the displacement. Note that the restoring force is proportional to the deformation x. The deformation can also be thought of as a displacement from equilibrium. It is a change in position due to a force. In the absence of force, the object would rest at its equilibrium position. The force constant k is related to the stiffness of a system. The larger the force constant, the stiffer the system. A stiffer system is more difficult to deform and requires a greater restoring force. The units of k are newtons per meter (N/m). One of the most common uses of Hooke’s law is solving problems involving springs and pendulums, which we will cover at the end of this section. Teacher Support [BL] Review the concept of force. [BL][OL][AL] Introduce Hooke’s law and force constant of a spring. Oscillations and Periodic Motion What do an ocean buoy, a child in a swing, a guitar, and the beating of hearts all have in common? They all oscillate. That is, they move back and forth between two points, like the ruler illustrated in . All oscillations involve force. For example, you push a child in a swing to get the motion started. A ruler is displaced from its equilibrium position. Teacher Support [BL][OL][AL] Find springs or rubber bands with different amounts of stiffness. Ask students to attach weights to these to construct oscillators. Introduce the terms frequency and time period. Ask students to observe how the stiffness of the spring affects them. How does mass of the system affect them? How does the initial force applied affect them? Newton’s first law implies that an object oscillating back and forth is experiencing forces. Without force, the object would move in a straight line at a constant speed rather than oscillate. Consider, for example, plucking a plastic ruler to the left as shown in . The deformation of the ruler creates a force in the opposite direction, known as a restoring force. Once released, the restoring force causes the ruler to move back toward its stable equilibrium position, where the net force on it is zero. However, by the time the ruler gets there, it gains momentum and continues to move to the right, producing the opposite deformation. It is then forced to the left, back through equilibrium, and the process is repeated until it gradually loses all of its energy. The simplest oscillations occur when the restoring force is directly proportional to displacement. Recall that Hooke’s law describes this situation with the equation F = −kx. Therefore, Hooke’s law describes and applies to the simplest case of oscillation, known as simple harmonic motion. (a) The plastic ruler has been released, and the restoring force is returning the ruler to its equilibrium position. (b) The net force is zero at the equilibrium position, but the ruler has momentum and continues to move to the right. (c) The restoring force is in the opposite direction. It stops the ruler and moves it back toward equilibrium again. (d) Now the ruler has momentum to the left. (e) In the absence of damping (caused by frictional forces), the ruler reaches its original position. From there, the motion will repeat itself. When you pluck a guitar string, the resulting sound has a steady tone and lasts a long time. Each vibration of the string takes the same time as the previous one. Periodic motion is a motion that repeats itself at regular time intervals, such as with an object bobbing up and down on a spring or a pendulum swinging back and forth. The time to complete one oscillation (a complete cycle of motion) remains constant and is called the period T. Its units are usually seconds. Frequency f is the number of oscillations per unit time. The SI unit for frequency is the hertz (Hz), defined as the number of oscillations per second. The relationship between frequency and period is f= 1/T . As you can see from the equation, frequency and period are different ways of expressing the same concept. For example, if you get a paycheck twice a month, you could say that the frequency of payment is two per month, or that the period between checks is half a month. If there is no friction to slow it down, then an object in simple motion will oscillate forever with equal displacement on either side of the equilibrium position. The equilibrium position is where the object would naturally rest in the absence of force. The maximum displacement from equilibrium is called the amplitude X. The units for amplitude and displacement are the same, but depend on the type of oscillation. For the object on the spring, shown in , the units of amplitude and displacement are meters. An object attached to a spring sliding on a frictionless surface is a simple harmonic oscillator. When displaced from equilibrium, the object performs simple harmonic motion that has an amplitude X and a period T. The object’s maximum speed occurs as it passes through equilibrium. The stiffer the spring is, the smaller the period T. The greater the mass of the object is, the greater the period T.The mass m and the force constant k are the only factors that affect the period and frequency of simple harmonic motion. The period of a simple harmonic oscillator is given by T=2π m k and, because f = 1/T, the frequency of a simple harmonic oscillator is f= 1 2π k m . Introduction to Harmonic Motion This video shows how to graph the displacement of a spring in the x-direction over time, based on the period. Watch the first 10 minutes of the video (you can stop when the narrator begins to cover calculus). Solving Spring and Pendulum Problems with Simple Harmonic Motion Before solving problems with springs and pendulums, it is important to first get an understanding of how a pendulum works. provides a useful illustration of a simple pendulum. A simple pendulum has a small-diameter bob and a string that has a very small mass but is strong enough not to stretch. The linear displacement from equilibrium is s, the length of the arc. Also shown are the forces on the bob, which result in a net force of −mg sinθ toward the equilibrium position—that is, a restoring force. Teacher Support [BL] Review simple harmonic motion. Everyday examples of pendulums include old-fashioned clocks, a child’s swing, or the sinker on a fishing line. For small displacements of less than 15 degrees, a pendulum experiences simple harmonic oscillation, meaning that its restoring force is directly proportional to its displacement. A pendulum in simple harmonic motion is called a simple pendulum. A pendulum has an object with a small mass, also known as the pendulum bob, which hangs from a light wire or string. The equilibrium position for a pendulum is where the angle θ is zero (that is, when the pendulum is hanging straight down). It makes sense that without any force applied, this is where the pendulum bob would rest. Teacher Support [BL][OL][AL]Construct simple pendulums of different lengths. Ask students to measure their time periods or frequencies. Are they constant for a given pendulum? How does the mass impact the frequency? How does the initial displacement affect it? What happens if a small push is given to the pendulum to get it started? Does that change the frequency? In what way does the length affect the frequency? The displacement of the pendulum bob is the arc length s. The weight mg has components mg cos θ along the string and mg sin θ tangent to the arc. Tension in the string exactly cancels the component mg cos θ parallel to the string. This leaves a net restoring force back toward the equilibrium position that runs tangent to the arc and equals −mg sin θ .For small angle oscillations of a simple pendulum, the period is T=2π L g . The only things that affect the period of a simple pendulum are its length and the acceleration due to gravity. The period is completely independent of other factors, such as mass or amplitude. However, note that T does depend on g. This means that if we know the length of a pendulum, we can actually use it to measure gravity! This will come in useful in . Tension is represented by the variable T, and period is represented by the variable T. It is important not to confuse the two, since tension is a force and period is a length of time. Measuring Acceleration due to Gravity: The Period of a Pendulum What is the acceleration due to gravity in a region where a simple pendulum having a length 75.000 cm has a period of 1.7357 s? Strategy We are asked to find g given the period T and the length L of a pendulum. We can solve T=2π L g for g, assuming that the angle of deflection is less than 15 degrees. Recall that when the angle of deflection is less than 15 degrees, the pendulum is considered to be in simple harmonic motion, allowing us to use this equation. Solution Square T=2π L g and solve for g. g=4 π 2 L T 2 Substitute known values into the new equation. g=4 π 2 0.75000 m (1.7357 s) 2 Calculate to find g. g= 9.8281 m/ s 2 Discussion This method for determining g can be very accurate. This is why length and period are given to five digits in this example. Hooke’s Law: How Stiff Are Car Springs? What is the force constant for the suspension system of a car, like that shown in , that settles 1.20 cm when an 80.0-kg person gets in? A car in a parking lot. (exfordy, Flickr)Strategy Consider the car to be in its equilibrium position x = 0 before the person gets in. The car then settles down 1.20 cm, which means it is displaced to a position x = −1.20×10−2 m. At that point, the springs supply a restoring force F equal to the person’s weight w = mg = (80.0 kg)(9.80 m/s2) = 784 N. We take this force to be F in Hooke’s law. Knowing F and x, we can then solve for the force constant k. Solution Solve Hooke’s law, F = −kx, for k. k= F x Substitute known values and solve for k. k = −784 N −1.20× 10 −2 m = 6.53× 10 4 N/m Discussion Note that F and x have opposite signs because they are in opposite directions—the restoring force is up, and the displacement is down. Also, note that the car would oscillate up and down when the person got in, if it were not for the shock absorbers. Bouncing cars are a sure sign of bad shock absorbers. Practice Problems Finding Gravity Using a Simple Pendulum Use a simple pendulum to find the acceleration due to gravity g in your home or classroom. 1 string 1 stopwatch 1 small dense object Cut a piece of a string or dental floss so that it is about 1 m long. Attach a small object of high density to the end of the string (for example, a metal nut or a car key). Starting at an angle of less than 10 degrees, allow the pendulum to swing and measure the pendulum’s period for 10 oscillations using a stopwatch. Calculate g. How accurate is this measurement for g? How might it be improved? Accuracy for value of g will increase with an increase in the mass of a dense object. Accuracy for the value of g will increase with increase in the length of the pendulum. The value of g will be more accurate if the angle of deflection is more than 15°. The value of g will be more accurate if it maintains simple harmonic motion.

The student is expected to: (C) analyze and describe accelerated motion in two dimensions using equations, including projectile and circular examples. Section Key Terms angle of rotation angular velocity arc length circular motion radius of curvature rotational motion spin tangential velocity Angle of Rotation What exactly do we mean by circular motion or rotation? Rotational motion is the circular motion of an object about an axis of rotation. We will discuss specifically circular motion and spin. Circular motion is when an object moves in a circular path. Examples of circular motion include a race car speeding around a circular curve, a toy attached to a string swinging in a circle around your head, or the circular loop-the-loop on a roller coaster. Spin is rotation about an axis that goes through the center of mass of the object, such as Earth rotating on its axis, a wheel turning on its axle, the spin of a tornado on its path of destruction, or a figure skater spinning during a performance at the Olympics. Sometimes, objects will be spinning while in circular motion, like the Earth spinning on its axis while revolving around the Sun, but we will focus on these two motions separately. Teacher Support [BL][OL] Explain the difference between circular and rotational motions by using the Earth’s rotation about its axis and its revolution about the Sun. Explain that Earth’s rotation is slightly elliptical, although it is very nearly circular. [OL][AL] Ask students to come up with examples of circular motion. When solving problems involving rotational motion, we use variables that are similar to linear variables (distance, velocity, acceleration, and force) but take into account the curvature or rotation of the motion. Here, we define the angle of rotation, which is the angular equivalence of distance; and angular velocity, which is the angular equivalence of linear velocity. When objects rotate about some axis—for example, when the CD in rotates about its center—each point in the object follows a circular path. All points on a CD travel in circular paths. The pits (dots) along a line from the center to the edge all move through the same angle Δθ in time Δt .The arc length, Δs, is the distance traveled along a circular path. The radius of curvature, r, is the radius of the circular path. Both are shown in . The radius (r) of a circle is rotated through an angle Δθ . The arc length, Δs , is the distance covered along the circumference.Consider a line from the center of the CD to its edge. In a given time, each pit (used to record information) on this line moves through the same angle. The angle of rotation is the amount of rotation and is the angular analog of distance. The angle of rotation Δθ is the arc length divided by the radius of curvature. Δθ= Δs r The angle of rotation is often measured by using a unit called the radian. (Radians are actually dimensionless, because a radian is defined as the ratio of two distances, radius and arc length.) A revolution is one complete rotation, where every point on the circle returns to its original position. One revolution covers 2π radians (or 360 degrees), and therefore has an angle of rotation of 2π radians, and an arc length that is the same as the circumference of the circle. We can convert between radians, revolutions, and degrees using the relationship 1 revolution = 2π rad = 360°. See for the conversion of degrees to radians for some common angles. 2π rad = 360° 1rad = 360° 2π ≈57.3° Commonly Used Angles in Terms of Degrees and Radians Degree Measures Radian Measures 30 ∘ π 6 60 ∘ π 3 90 ∘ π 2 120 ∘ 2π 3 135 ∘ 3π 4 180 ∘ π Angular Velocity Teacher Support [BL] Review displacement, speed, velocity, acceleration. [AL] Ask students whether or not velocity changes in uniform circular motion. What about speed? What about acceleration? How fast is an object rotating? We can answer this question by using the concept of angular velocity. Consider first the angular speed (ω) is the rate at which the angle of rotation changes. In equation form, the angular speed is ω= Δθ Δt , which means that an angular rotation (Δθ) occurs in a time, Δt . If an object rotates through a greater angle of rotation in a given time, it has a greater angular speed. The units for angular speed are radians per second (rad/s). Now let’s consider the direction of the angular speed, which means we now must call it the angular velocity. The direction of the angular velocity is along the axis of rotation. For an object rotating clockwise, the angular velocity points away from you along the axis of rotation. For an object rotating counterclockwise, the angular velocity points toward you along the axis of rotation. Angular velocity (ω) is the angular version of linear velocity v. Tangential velocity is the instantaneous linear velocity of an object in rotational motion. To get the precise relationship between angular velocity and tangential velocity, consider again a pit on the rotating CD. This pit moves through an arc length (Δs) in a short time (Δt) so its tangential speed is v= Δs Δt . From the definition of the angle of rotation, Δθ= Δs r , we see that Δs=rΔθ . Substituting this into the expression for v gives v= rΔθ Δt =rω . The equation v=rω says that the tangential speed v is proportional to the distance r from the center of rotation. Consequently, tangential speed is greater for a point on the outer edge of the CD (with larger r) than for a point closer to the center of the CD (with smaller r). This makes sense because a point farther out from the center has to cover a longer arc length in the same amount of time as a point closer to the center. Note that both points will still have the same angular speed, regardless of their distance from the center of rotation. See . Points 1 and 2 rotate through the same angle ( Δθ ), but point 2 moves through a greater arc length ( Δ s 2 ) because it is farther from the center of rotation. Teacher Support [AL] Explain that the time period Δt in the equation that defines tangential velocity ( v= Δs Δt ) must be short so that the arc described by the moving object can be approximated as a straight line. This allows us to define the direction of the tangential velocity as being tangent to the circle. This approximation becomes increasingly accurate as Δt becomes increasingly small. Now, consider another example: the tire of a moving car (see ). The faster the tire spins, the faster the car moves—large ω means large v because v=rω . Similarly, a larger-radius tire rotating at the same angular velocity, ω , will produce a greater linear (tangential) velocity, v, for the car. This is because a larger radius means a longer arc length must contact the road, so the car must move farther in the same amount of time. A car moving at a velocity, v, to the right has a tire rotating with angular velocity ω . The speed of the tread of the tire relative to the axle is v, the same as if the car were jacked up and the wheels spinning without touching the road. Directly below the axle, where the tire touches the road, the tire tread moves backward with respect to the axle with tangential velocity v=rω , where r is the tire radius. Because the road is stationary with respect to this point of the tire, the car must move forward at the linear velocity v. A larger angular velocity for the tire means a greater linear velocity for the car.However, there are cases where linear velocity and tangential velocity are not equivalent, such as a car spinning its tires on ice. In this case, the linear velocity will be less than the tangential velocity. Due to the lack of friction under the tires of a car on ice, the arc length through which the tire treads move is greater than the linear distance through which the car moves. It’s similar to running on a treadmill or pedaling a stationary bike; you are literally going nowhere fast. Angular velocity ω and tangential velocity v are vectors, so we must include magnitude and direction. The direction of the angular velocity is along the axis of rotation, and points away from you for an object rotating clockwise, and toward you for an object rotating counterclockwise. In mathematics this is described by the right-hand rule. Tangential velocity is usually described as up, down, left, right, north, south, east, or west, as shown in . As the fly on the edge of an old-fashioned vinyl record moves in a circle, its instantaneous velocity is always at a tangent to the circle. The direction of the angular velocity is into the page this case. Relationship between Angular Velocity and Speed This video reviews the definition and units of angular velocity and relates it to linear speed. It also shows how to convert between revolutions and radians. Solving Problems Involving Angle of Rotation and Angular Velocity Measuring Angular Speed In this activity, you will create and measure uniform circular motion and then contrast it with circular motions with different radii. One string (1 m long) One object (two-hole rubber stopper) to tie to the end One timer Procedure Tie an object to the end of a string. Swing the object around in a horizontal circle above your head (swing from your wrist). It is important that the circle be horizontal! Maintain the object at uniform speed as it swings. Measure the angular speed of the object in this manner. Measure the time it takes in seconds for the object to travel 10 revolutions. Divide 10 revolutions by that time to get the angular speed in revolutions per second, which you can convert to radians per second. What is the approximate linear speed of the object? Move your hand up the string so that the length of the string is 90 cm. Repeat steps 2–5. Move your hand up the string so that its length is 80 cm. Repeat steps 2–5. Move your hand up the string so that its length is 70 cm. Repeat steps 2–5. Move your hand up the string so that its length is 60 cm. Repeat steps 2–5 Move your hand up the string so that its length is 50 cm. Repeat steps 2–5 Make graphs of angular speed vs. radius (i.e. string length) and linear speed vs. radius. Describe what each graph looks like. Now that we have an understanding of the concepts of angle of rotation and angular velocity, we’ll apply them to the real-world situations of a clock tower and a spinning tire. Angle of rotation at a Clock Tower The clock on a clock tower has a radius of 1.0 m. (a) What angle of rotation does the hour hand of the clock travel through when it moves from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m.? (b) What’s the arc length along the outermost edge of the clock between the hour hand at these two times? Strategy We can figure out the angle of rotation by multiplying a full revolution ( 2π radians) by the fraction of the 12 hours covered by the hour hand in going from 12 to 3. Once we have the angle of rotation, we can solve for the arc length by rearranging the equation Δθ= Δs r since the radius is given. Solution to (a) In going from 12 to 3, the hour hand covers 1/4 of the 12 hours needed to make a complete revolution. Therefore, the angle between the hour hand at 12 and at 3 is 1 4 ×2πrad= π 2 (i.e., 90 degrees). Solution to (b) Rearranging the equation Δθ= Δs r , we get Δs=rΔθ . Inserting the known values gives an arc length of Δs = ( 1.0m )( π 2 rad ) = 1.6m Discussion We were able to drop the radians from the final solution to part (b) because radians are actually dimensionless. This is because the radian is defined as the ratio of two distances (radius and arc length). Thus, the formula gives an answer in units of meters, as expected for an arc length. How Fast Does a Car Tire Spin? Calculate the angular speed of a 0.300 m radius car tire when the car travels at 15.0 m/s (about 54 km/h). See . Strategy In this case, the speed of the tire tread with respect to the tire axle is the same as the speed of the car with respect to the road, so we have v = 15.0 m/s. The radius of the tire is r = 0.300 m. Since we know v and r, we can rearrange the equation v=rω , to get ω= v r and find the angular speed. Solution To find the angular speed, we use the relationship: ω= v r . Inserting the known quantities gives ω = 15.0m/s 0.300m = 50.0rad/s. Discussion When we cancel units in the above calculation, we get 50.0/s (i.e., 50.0 per second, which is usually written as 50.0 s−1). But the angular speed must have units of rad/s. Because radians are dimensionless, we can insert them into the answer for the angular speed because we know that the motion is circular. Also note that, if an earth mover with much larger tires, say 1.20 m in radius, were moving at the same speed of 15.0 m/s, its tires would rotate more slowly. They would have an angular speed of ω = 15.0m/s 1.20m = 12.5rad/s Practice Problems What is the angle in degrees between the hour hand and the minute hand of a clock showing 9:00 a.m.? 0° 90° 180° 360° What is the approximate value of the arc length between the hour hand and the minute hand of a clock showing 10:00 a.m if the radius of the clock is 0.2 m? 0.1 m 0.2 m 0.3 m 0.6 m Check Your Understanding What is meant by radius of curvature when describing rotational motion? The radius of curvature is the radius of a circular path. The radius of curvature is the diameter of a circular path. The radius of curvature is the circumference of a circular path. The radius of curvature is the area of a circular path. Teacher Support Use the Check Your Understanding questions to assess whether students master the learning objectives of this section. If students are struggling with a specific objective, the formative assessment will help identify which objective is causing the problem and direct students to the relevant content. Section Summary Circular motion is motion in a circular path. The angle of rotation Δθ is defined as the ratio of the arc length to the radius of curvature. The arc length Δs is the distance traveled along a circular path and r is the radius of curvature of the circular path. The angle of rotation Δθ is measured in units of radians (rad), where 2πrad=360°=1 revolution. Angular velocity ω is the rate of change of an angle, where a rotation Δθ occurs in a time Δt . The units of angular velocity are radians per second (rad/s). Tangential speed v and angular speed ω are related by v=rω , and tangential velocity has units of m/s. The direction of angular velocity is along the axis of rotation, away (toward) from you for clockwise (counterclockwise) motion. Key Equations Angle of rotation Δθ= Δs r Angular speed: ω= Δθ Δt Tangential speed: v=rω Concept Items What kind of motion is called spin? Spin is rotational motion of an object about an axis parallel to the axis of the object. Spin is translational motion of an object about an axis parallel to the axis of the object.

The student is expected to: (C) analyze and describe accelerated motion in two dimensions using equations, including projectile and circular examples. Section Key Terms centrifugal force centripetal acceleration centripetal force uniform circular motion Centripetal Acceleration Teacher Support [BL][OL] Review uniform circular motion. Ask students to give examples of circular motion. Review linear acceleration. In the previous section, we defined circular motion. The simplest case of circular motion is uniform circular motion, where an object travels a circular path at a constant speed. Note that, unlike speed, the linear velocity of an object in circular motion is constantly changing because it is always changing direction. We know from kinematics that acceleration is a change in velocity, either in magnitude or in direction or both. Therefore, an object undergoing uniform circular motion is always accelerating, even though the magnitude of its velocity is constant. You experience this acceleration yourself every time you ride in a car while it turns a corner. If you hold the steering wheel steady during the turn and move at a constant speed, you are executing uniform circular motion. What you notice is a feeling of sliding (or being flung, depending on the speed) away from the center of the turn. This isn’t an actual force that is acting on you—it only happens because your body wants to continue moving in a straight line (as per Newton’s first law) whereas the car is turning off this straight-line path. Inside the car it appears as if you are forced away from the center of the turn. This fictitious force is known as the centrifugal force. The sharper the curve and the greater your speed, the more noticeable this effect becomes. Teacher Support [BL][OL][AL] Demonstrate circular motion by tying a weight to a string and twirling it around. Ask students what would happen if you suddenly cut the string? In which direction would the object travel? Why? What does this say about the direction of acceleration? Ask students to give examples of when they have come across centripetal acceleration. shows an object moving in a circular path at constant speed. The direction of the instantaneous tangential velocity is shown at two points along the path. Acceleration is in the direction of the change in velocity; in this case it points roughly toward the center of rotation. (The center of rotation is at the center of the circular path). If we imagine Δs becoming smaller and smaller, then the acceleration would point exactly toward the center of rotation, but this case is hard to draw. We call the acceleration of an object moving in uniform circular motion the centripetal acceleration ac because centripetal means center seeking. The directions of the velocity of an object at two different points are shown, and the change in velocity Δv is seen to point approximately toward the center of curvature (see small inset). For an extremely small value of Δs , Δv points exactly toward the center of the circle (but this is hard to draw). Because a c =Δv/Δt , the acceleration is also toward the center, so ac is called centripetal acceleration. Teacher Support Consider . The figure shows an object moving in a circular path at constant speed and the direction of the instantaneous velocity of two points along the path. Acceleration is in the direction of the change in velocity and points toward the center of rotation. This is strictly true only as Δs tends to zero. Now that we know that the direction of centripetal acceleration is toward the center of rotation, let’s discuss the magnitude of centripetal acceleration. For an object traveling at speed v in a circular path with radius r, the magnitude of centripetal acceleration is a c = v 2 r . Centripetal acceleration is greater at high speeds and in sharp curves (smaller radius), as you may have noticed when driving a car, because the car actually pushes you toward the center of the turn. But it is a bit surprising that ac is proportional to the speed squared. This means, for example, that the acceleration is four times greater when you take a curve at 100 km/h than at 50 km/h. We can also express ac in terms of the magnitude of angular velocity. Substituting v=rω into the equation above, we get a c = (rω) 2 r =r ω 2 . Therefore, the magnitude of centripetal acceleration in terms of the magnitude of angular velocity is a c =r ω 2 . The equation expressed in the form ac = rω2 is useful for solving problems where you know the angular velocity rather than the tangential velocity. Ladybug Motion in 2D In this simulation, you experiment with the position, velocity, and acceleration of a ladybug in circular and elliptical motion. Switch the type of motion from linear to circular and observe the velocity and acceleration vectors. Next, try elliptical motion and notice how the velocity and acceleration vectors differ from those in circular motion. In uniform circular motion, what is the angle between the acceleration and the velocity? What type of acceleration does a body experience in the uniform circular motion? The angle between acceleration and velocity is 0°, and the body experiences linear acceleration. The angle between acceleration and velocity is 0°, and the body experiences centripetal acceleration. The angle between acceleration and velocity is 90°, and the body experiences linear acceleration. The angle between acceleration and velocity is 90°, and the body experiences centripetal acceleration. Centripetal Force Teacher Support [BL][OL][AL] Using the same demonstration as before, ask students to predict the relationships between the quantities of angular velocity, centripetal acceleration, mass, centripetal force. Invite students to experiment by using various lengths of string and different weights. Because an object in uniform circular motion undergoes acceleration (by changing the direction of motion but not the speed), we know from Newton’s second law of motion that there must be a net external force acting on the object. Since the magnitude of the acceleration is constant, so is the magnitude of the net force, and since the acceleration points toward the center of the rotation, so does the net force. Any force or combination of forces can cause a centripetal acceleration. Just a few examples are the tension in the rope on a tether ball, the force of Earth’s gravity on the Moon, the friction between a road and the tires of a car as it goes around a curve, or the normal force of a roller coaster track on the cart during a loop-the-loop. The component of any net force that causes circular motion is called a centripetal force. When the net force is equal to the centripetal force, and its magnitude is constant, uniform circular motion results. The direction of a centripetal force is toward the center of rotation, the same as for centripetal acceleration. According to Newton’s second law of motion, a net force causes the acceleration of mass according to Fnet = ma. For uniform circular motion, the acceleration is centripetal acceleration: a = ac. Therefore, the magnitude of centripetal force, Fc, is F c =m a c .By using the two different forms of the equation for the magnitude of centripetal acceleration, a c = v 2 /r and a c =r ω 2 , we get two expressions involving the magnitude of the centripetal force Fc. The first expression is in terms of tangential speed, the second is in terms of angular speed: F c =m v 2 r and F c =mr ω 2 .Both forms of the equation depend on mass, velocity, and the radius of the circular path. You may use whichever expression for centripetal force is more convenient. Newton’s second law also states that the object will accelerate in the same direction as the net force. By definition, the centripetal force is directed towards the center of rotation, so the object will also accelerate towards the center. A straight line drawn from the circular path to the center of the circle will always be perpendicular to the tangential velocity. Note that, if you solve the first expression for r, you get r= m v 2 F c . From this expression, we see that, for a given mass and velocity, a large centripetal force causes a small radius of curvature—that is, a tight curve. In this figure, the frictional force f serves as the centripetal force Fc. Centripetal force is perpendicular to tangential velocity and causes uniform circular motion. The larger the centripetal force Fc, the smaller is the radius of curvature r and the sharper is the curve. The lower curve has the same velocity v, but a larger centripetal force Fc produces a smaller radius r ′ .Centripetal Force and Acceleration Intuition This video explains why centripetal force, when it is equal to the net force and has constant magnitude, creates centripetal acceleration and uniform circular motion. Teacher Support Some students might be confused between centripetal force and centrifugal force. Centrifugal force is not a real force but the result of an accelerating reference frame, such as a turning car or the spinning Earth. Centrifugal force refers to a fictional center fleeing force. Solving Centripetal Acceleration and Centripetal Force Problems To get a feel for the typical magnitudes of centripetal acceleration, we’ll do a lab estimating the centripetal acceleration of a tennis racket and then, in our first Worked Example, compare the centripetal acceleration of a car rounding a curve to gravitational acceleration. For the second Worked Example, we’ll calculate the force required to make a car round a curve. Estimating Centripetal Acceleration In this activity, you will measure the swing of a golf club or tennis racket to estimate the centripetal acceleration of the end of the club or racket. You may choose to do this in slow motion. Recall that the equation for centripetal acceleration is a c = v 2 r or a c =r ω 2 . One tennis racket or golf club One timer One ruler or tape measure Procedure Work with a partner. Stand a safe distance away from your partner as he or she swings the golf club or tennis racket. Describe the motion of the swing—is this uniform circular motion? Why or why not? Try to get the swing as close to uniform circular motion as possible. What adjustments did your partner need to make? Measure the radius of curvature. What did you physically measure? By using the timer, find either the linear or angular velocity, depending on which equation you decide to use. What is the approximate centripetal acceleration based on these measurements? How accurate do you think they are? Why? How might you and your partner make these measurements more accurate? Teacher Support The swing of the golf club or racket can be made very close to uniform circular motion. For this, the person would have to move it at a constant speed, without bending their arm. The length of the arm plus the length of the club or racket is the radius of curvature. Accuracy of measurements of angular velocity and angular acceleration will depend on resolution of the timer used and human observational error. The swing of the golf club or racket can be made very close to uniform circular motion. For this, the person would have to move it at a constant speed, without bending their arm. The length of the arm plus the length of the club or racket is the radius of curvature. Accuracy of measurements of angular velocity and angular acceleration will depend on resolution of the timer used and human observational error. Was it more useful to use the equation a c = v 2 r or a c =r ω 2 in this activity? Why? It should be simpler to use a c =r ω 2 because measuring angular velocity through observation would be easier. It should be simpler to use a c = v 2 r because measuring tangential velocity through observation would be easier. It should be simpler to use a c =r ω 2 because measuring angular velocity through observation would be difficult. It should be simpler to use a c = v 2 r because measuring tangential velocity through observation would be difficult. Comparing Centripetal Acceleration of a Car Rounding a Curve with Acceleration Due to Gravity A car follows a curve of radius 500 m at a speed of 25.0 m/s (about 90 km/h). What is the magnitude of the car’s centripetal acceleration? Compare the centripetal acceleration for this fairly gentle curve taken at highway speed with acceleration due to gravity (g). Strategy Because linear rather than angular speed is given, it is most convenient to use the expression a c = v 2 r to find the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration. Solution Entering the given values of v = 25.0 m/s and r = 500 m into the expression for ac gives a c = v 2 r = ( 25.0m/s ) 2 500m = 1.25 m/s 2 . Discussion To compare this with the acceleration due to gravity (g = 9.80 m/s2), we take the ratio a c /g = (1.25 m/s 2 )/ (9.80 m/s 2 ) =0.128 . Therefore, a c =0.128g , which means that the centripetal acceleration is about one tenth the acceleration due to gravity. Frictional Force on Car Tires Rounding a Curve Calculate the centripetal force exerted on a 900 kg car that rounds a 600-m-radius curve on horizontal ground at 25.0 m/s. Static friction prevents the car from slipping. Find the magnitude of the frictional force between the tires and the road that allows the car to round the curve without sliding off in a straight line. If the car would slip if it were to be traveling any faster, what is the coefficient of static friction between the tires and the road? Could we conclude anything about the coefficient of static friction if we did not know whether the car could round the curve any faster without slipping? Strategy and Solution for (a) We know that F c =m v 2 r . Therefore, F c = m v 2 r = ( 900kg ) ( 25.0m/s ) 2 600m = 938N. Strategy and Solution for (b) The image above shows the forces acting on the car while rounding the curve. In this diagram, the car is traveling into the page as shown and is turning to the left. Friction acts toward the left, accelerating the car toward the center of the curve. Because friction is the only horizontal force acting on the car, it provides all of the centripetal force in this case. Therefore, the force of friction is the centripetal force in this situation and points toward the center of the curve. f= F c =938N Strategy and Solution for (c) If the car is about to slip, the static friction is at its maximum value and f =μsN =μsmg . Solving for μs, we get μs = 938 900×9.8 =0.11 . Regardless of whether we know the maximum allowable speed for rounding the curve, we can conclude this is a minimum value for the coefficient. Discussion Since we found the force of friction in part (b), we could also solve for the coefficient of friction, since f= μ s N= μ s mg . The static friction is only equal to μs N when it is at the maximum possible value. If the car could go faster, the friction at the given speed would still be the same as we calculated, but the coefficient of static friction would be larger.

Section Summary Centripetal acceleration ac is the acceleration experienced while in uniform circular motion. Centripetal acceleration force is a center-seeking force that always points toward the center of rotation, perpendicular to the linear velocity, in the same direction as the net force, and in the direction opposite that of the radius vector. The standard unit for centripetal acceleration is m/s2. Centripetal force Fc is any net force causing uniform circular motion.

Section Key Terms angular acceleration kinematics of rotational motion lever arm tangential acceleration torque Rotational Kinematics Teacher Support [BL][OL] Review linear kinematic equations. Students may get confused between deceleration and increasing acceleration in the negative direction. In the section on uniform circular motion, we discussed motion in a circle at constant speed and, therefore, constant angular velocity. However, there are times when angular velocity is not constant—rotational motion can speed up, slow down, or reverse directions. Angular velocity is not constant when a spinning skater pulls in her arms, when a child pushes a merry-go-round to make it rotate, or when a CD slows to a halt when switched off. In all these cases, angular acceleration occurs because the angular velocity ω changes. The faster the change occurs, the greater is the angular acceleration. Angular acceleration α is the rate of change of angular velocity. In equation form, average angular acceleration is α= Δω Δt , where Δω is the change in angular velocity and Δt is the change in time. The units of angular acceleration are (rad/s)/s, or rad/s2. If ω increases, then α is positive. If ω decreases, then α is negative. Keep in mind that, by convention, counterclockwise is the positive direction and clockwise is the negative direction. For example, the skater in is rotating counterclockwise as seen from above, so her angular velocity is positive. Acceleration would be negative, for example, when an object that is rotating counterclockwise slows down. It would be positive when an object that is rotating counterclockwise speeds up. A figure skater spins in the counterclockwise direction, so her angular velocity is normally considered to be positive. (Luu, Wikimedia Commons)The relationship between the magnitudes of tangential acceleration, a, and angular acceleration, α,isa=rαorα= a r . These equations mean that the magnitudes of tangential acceleration and angular acceleration are directly proportional to each other. The greater the angular acceleration, the larger the change in tangential acceleration, and vice versa. For example, consider riders in their pods on a Ferris wheel at rest. A Ferris wheel with greater angular acceleration will give the riders greater tangential acceleration because, as the Ferris wheel increases its rate of spinning, it also increases its tangential velocity. Note that the radius of the spinning object also matters. For example, for a given angular acceleration α , a smaller Ferris wheel leads to a smaller tangential acceleration for the riders. Tangential acceleration is sometimes denoted at. It is a linear acceleration in a direction tangent to the circle at the point of interest in circular or rotational motion. Remember that tangential acceleration is parallel to the tangential velocity (either in the same direction or in the opposite direction.) Centripetal acceleration is always perpendicular to the tangential velocity. So far, we have defined three rotational variables: θ , ω , and α . These are the angular versions of the linear variables x, v, and a. The following equations in the table represent the magnitude of the rotational variables and only when the radius is constant and perpendicular to the rotational variable. shows how they are related. Rotational and Linear Variables Rotational Linear Relationship θ x θ= x r ω v ω= v r α a α= a r We can now begin to see how rotational quantities like θ , ω , and α are related to each other. For example, if a motorcycle wheel that starts at rest has a large angular acceleration for a fairly long time, it ends up spinning rapidly and rotates through many revolutions. Putting this in terms of the variables, if the wheel’s angular acceleration α is large for a long period of time t, then the final angular velocity ω and angle of rotation θ are large. In the case of linear motion, if an object starts at rest and undergoes a large linear acceleration, then it has a large final velocity and will have traveled a large distance. The kinematics of rotational motion describes the relationships between the angle of rotation, angular velocity, angular acceleration, and time. It only describes motion—it does not include any forces or masses that may affect rotation (these are part of dynamics). Recall the kinematics equation for linear motion: v= v 0 +at (constant a). As in linear kinematics, we assume a is constant, which means that angular acceleration α is also a constant, because a=rα . The equation for the kinematics relationship between ω , α , and t is ω= ω 0 +αt(constantα), where ω 0 is the initial angular velocity. Notice that the equation is identical to the linear version, except with angular analogs of the linear variables. In fact, all of the linear kinematics equations have rotational analogs, which are given in . These equations can be used to solve rotational or linear kinematics problem in which a and α are constant. Equations for Rotational Kinematics Rotational Linear θ= ω ¯ t x= v ¯ t ω= ω 0 +αt v= v 0 +at constant α , a θ= ω 0 t+ 1 2 α t 2 x= v 0 t+ 1 2 a t 2 constant α , a ω 2 = ω 0 2 +2αθ v 2 = v 0 2 +2ax constant α , a In these equations, ω 0 and v 0 are initial values, t 0 is zero, and the average angular velocity ω ¯ and average velocity v ¯ are ω ¯ = ω 0 +ω 2 and v ¯ = v 0 +v 2 . Storm Chasing Tornadoes descend from clouds in funnel-like shapes that spin violently. (Daphne Zaras, U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) Storm chasers tend to fall into one of four groups: Amateurs chasing tornadoes as a hobby, atmospheric scientists gathering data for research, weather watchers for news media, or scientists having fun under the guise of work. Storm chasing is a dangerous pastime because tornadoes can change course rapidly with little warning. Since storm chasers follow in the wake of the destruction left by tornadoes, changing flat tires due to debris left on the highway is common. The most active part of the world for tornadoes, called tornado alley, is in the central United States, between the Rocky Mountains and Appalachian Mountains. Tornadoes are perfect examples of rotational motion in action in nature. They come out of severe thunderstorms called supercells, which have a column of air rotating around a horizontal axis, usually about four miles across. The difference in wind speeds between the strong cold winds higher up in the atmosphere in the jet stream and weaker winds traveling north from the Gulf of Mexico causes the axis of the column of rotating air to shift as the storm travels so that the axis becomes vertical, creating a tornado. Tornadoes produce wind speeds as high as 500 km/h (approximately 300 miles/h), particularly at the bottom where the funnel is narrowest because the rate of rotation increases as the radius decreases. They blow houses away as if they were made of paper and have been known to pierce tree trunks with pieces of straw. Torque If you have ever spun a bike wheel or pushed a merry-go-round, you know that force is needed to change angular velocity. The farther the force is applied from the pivot point (or fulcrum), the greater the angular acceleration. For example, a door opens slowly if you push too close to its hinge, but opens easily if you push far from the hinges. Furthermore, we know that the more massive the door is, the more slowly it opens; this is because angular acceleration is inversely proportional to mass. These relationships are very similar to the relationships between force, mass, and acceleration from Newton’s second law of motion. Since we have already covered the angular versions of distance, velocity and time, you may wonder what the angular version of force is, and how it relates to linear force. The angular version of force is torque τ , which is the turning effectiveness of a force. See . The equation for the magnitude of torque is τ=rFsinθ, where r is the distance from the pivot point to the point where the force is applied, F is the magnitude of the linear force, and θ is the angle between the lever arm and the force. The lever arm is the vector from the point of rotation (pivot point or fulcrum) to the location where force is applied. Since the magnitude of the lever arm is a distance, its units are in meters, and torque has units of N⋅m. Torque is a vector quantity and has the same direction as the angular acceleration that it produces. A man pushes a merry-go-round at its edge and perpendicular to the lever arm to achieve maximum torque. Applying a stronger torque will produce a greater angular acceleration. For example, the harder the man pushes the merry-go-round in , the faster it accelerates. Furthermore, the more massive the merry-go-round is, the slower it accelerates for the same torque. If the man wants to maximize the effect of his force on the merry-go-round, he should push as far from the center as possible to get the largest lever arm and, therefore, the greatest torque and angular acceleration. Torque is also maximized when the force is applied perpendicular to the lever arm. Teacher Support [BL][OL][AL] Demonstrate the physical relationships between torque, force, angle of application of force, and length of lever arm by using levers of different lengths. Help students make the connections between the physical observations and mathematical relationships. For instance, torque is maximum when the force is applied exactly perpendicular to the lever arm because sinθ=1 for θ=90 degrees. Solving Rotational Kinematics and Torque Problems Just as linear forces can balance to produce zero net force and no linear acceleration, the same is true of rotational motion. When two torques of equal magnitude act in opposing directions, there is no net torque and no angular acceleration, as you can see in the following video. If zero net torque acts on a system spinning at a constant angular velocity, the system will continue to spin at the same angular velocity. Introduction to Torque This video defines torque in terms of moment arm (which is the same as lever arm). It also covers a problem with forces acting in opposing directions about a pivot point. (At this stage, you can ignore Sal’s references to work and mechanical advantage.) Now let’s look at examples applying rotational kinematics to a fishing reel and the concept of torque to a merry-go-round. Calculating the Time for a Fishing Reel to Stop Spinning A deep-sea fisherman uses a fishing rod with a reel of radius 4.50 cm. A big fish takes the bait and swims away from the boat, pulling the fishing line from his fishing reel. As the fishing line unwinds from the reel, the reel spins at an angular velocity of 220 rad/s. The fisherman applies a brake to the spinning reel, creating an angular acceleration of −300 rad/s2. How long does it take the reel to come to a stop? Strategy We are asked to find the time t for the reel to come to a stop. The magnitude of the initial angular velocity is ω 0 =220 rad/s, and the magnitude of the final angular velocity ω=0 . The signed magnitude of the angular acceleration is α=−300 rad/s2, where the minus sign indicates that it acts in the direction opposite to the angular velocity. Looking at the rotational kinematic equations, we see all quantities but t are known in the equation ω= ω 0 +αt , making it the easiest equation to use for this problem. Solution The equation to use is ω= ω 0 +αt . We solve the equation algebraically for t, and then insert the known values. t = ω− ω 0 α = 0−220rad/s −300 rad/s 2 = 0.733s Discussion The time to stop the reel is fairly small because the acceleration is fairly large. Fishing lines sometimes snap because of the forces involved, and fishermen often let the fish swim for a while before applying brakes on the reel. A tired fish will be slower, requiring a smaller acceleration and therefore a smaller force. Calculating the Torque on a Merry-Go-Round Consider the man pushing the playground merry-go-round in . He exerts a force of 250 N at the edge of the merry-go-round and perpendicular to the radius, which is 1.50 m. How much torque does he produce? Assume that friction acting on the merry-go-round is negligible. Strategy To find the torque, note that the applied force is perpendicular to the radius and that friction is negligible. Solution τ = rFsinθ = ( 1.50m )( 250N )sin( π 2 ). = 375N⋅m Discussion The man maximizes the torque by applying force perpendicular to the lever arm, so that θ= π 2 and sinθ=1 . The man also maximizes his torque by pushing at the outer edge of the merry-go-round, so that he gets the largest-possible lever arm.

Section Summary Kinematics is the description of motion. The kinematics of rotational motion describes the relationships between rotation angle, angular velocity, angular acceleration, and time. Torque is the effectiveness of a force to change the rotational speed of an object. Torque is the rotational analog of force. The lever arm is the distance between the point of rotation (pivot point) and the location where force is applied. Torque is maximized by applying force perpendicular to the lever arm and at a point as far as possible from the pivot point or fulcrum. If torque is zero, angular acceleration is zero.

Both have the same linear instantaneous velocities at their edges. Which top has a higher angular velocity? the top with the smaller radius because the radius of curvature is inversely proportional to the angular velocity the top with the smaller radius because the radius of curvature is directly proportional to the angular velocity the top with the larger radius because the radius of curvature is inversely proportional to the angular velocity The top with the larger radius because the radius of curvature is directly proportional to the angular velocity Problems An objects angular acceleration is 36 rad/s2.

Johannes Kepler discovered three laws of planetary motion that all orbiting planets and moons follow. Years later, Isaac Newton found these laws useful in developing his law of universal gravitation. This law relates gravitational force to the masses of objects and the distance between them. Many years later still, Albert Einstein showed there was a little more to the gravitation story when he published his theory of general relativity.

The student knows and applies the laws governing motion in a variety of situations. The student is expected to: (C) analyze and describe accelerated motion in two dimensions using equations, including projectile and circular examples. In this section students will apply Kepler’s laws of planetary motion to objects in the solar system. [BL][OL] Discuss the historical setting in which Kepler worked. Most people still thought Earth was the center of the universe, and yet Kepler not only knew that the planets circled the sun, he found patterns in the paths they followed. What would it be like to be that far ahead of almost everyone? A fascinating description of this is given in the program Cosmos with Carl Sagan (Episode 3, Harmony of the Worlds).[AL] Explain that Kepler’s laws were laws and not theories. Laws describe patterns in nature that always repeat themselves under the same set of conditions. Theories provide an explanation for the patterns. Kepler provided no explanation. Section Key Terms aphelion Copernican model eccentricity Kepler’s laws of planetary motion perihelion Ptolemaic model Concepts Related to Kepler’s Laws of Planetary Motion Examples of orbits abound. Hundreds of artificial satellites orbit Earth together with thousands of pieces of debris. The moon’s orbit around Earth has intrigued humans from time immemorial. The orbits of planets, asteroids, meteors, and comets around the sun are no less interesting. If we look farther, we see almost unimaginable numbers of stars, galaxies, and other celestial objects orbiting one another and interacting through gravity. All these motions are governed by gravitational force. The orbital motions of objects in our own solar system are simple enough to describe with a few fairly simple laws. The orbits of planets and moons satisfy the following two conditions: The mass of the orbiting object, m, is small compared to the mass of the object it orbits, M. The system is isolated from other massive objects. Teacher Support [OL] Ask the students to explain the criteria to see if they understand relative mass and isolated systems. Based on the motion of the planets about the sun, Kepler devised a set of three classical laws, called Kepler’s laws of planetary motion, that describe the orbits of all bodies satisfying these two conditions: The orbit of each planet around the sun is an ellipse with the sun at one focus. Each planet moves so that an imaginary line drawn from the sun to the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times. The ratio of the squares of the periods of any two planets about the sun is equal to the ratio of the cubes of their average distances from the sun. These descriptive laws are named for the German astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571–1630). He devised them after careful study (over some 20 years) of a large amount of meticulously recorded observations of planetary motion done by Tycho Brahe (1546–1601). Such careful collection and detailed recording of methods and data are hallmarks of good science. Data constitute the evidence from which new interpretations and meanings can be constructed. Let’s look closer at each of these laws. Teacher Support [BL] Relate orbit to year and rotation to day. Be sure that students know that an object rotates on its axis and revolves around a parent body as it follows its orbit. [OL] See how many levels of orbital motion the students know and fill in the ones they don’t. For example, moons orbit around planets; planets around stars; stars around the center of the galaxy, etc. [AL] From the point of view of Earth, which objects appear (incorrectly) to be orbiting Earth (stars, the sun, galaxies) and which can be seen to be orbiting parent bodies (the moon, moons of other planets, stars in other galaxies)? Kepler’s First Law The orbit of each planet about the sun is an ellipse with the sun at one focus, as shown in . The planet’s closest approach to the sun is called perihelion and its farthest distance from the sun is called aphelion. (a) An ellipse is a closed curve such that the sum of the distances from a point on the curve to the two foci (f1 and f2) is constant. (b) For any closed orbit, m follows an elliptical path with M at one focus. (c) The aphelion (ra) is the furthest distance between the planet and the sun, while the perihelion (rp) is the closest distance from the sun. Teacher Support [AL] Ask for a definition of planet. Prepare to discuss Pluto’s demotion if it comes up. Discuss the first criterion in terms of center of rotation of a moon-planet system. Explain that for all planet-moon systems in the solar system, the center of rotation is within the planet. This is not true for Pluto and its largest moon, Charon, because their masses are similar enough that they rotate around a point in space between them. If you know the aphelion (ra) and perihelion (rp) distances, then you can calculate the semi-major axis (a) and semi-minor axis (b). a= ( r a + r p ) 2 b= r a r p Teacher Support [AL] If any students are interested and proficient in algebra and geometry, ask them to derive a formula that relates the length of the string and the distance between pins to the major and minor axes of an ellipse. Explain that this is a real world problem for workers who design elliptical tabletops and mirrors. [BL][OL] Impress upon the students that Kepler had to crunch an enormous amount of data and that all his calculations had to be done by hand. Ask students to think of similar projects where scientists found order in a daunting amount of data (the periodic table, DNA structure, climate models, etc.). Demonstrate the pins and string method of drawing an ellipse, as shown in , or have the students try it at home or in class. Ask students: Why does the string and pin method create a shape that conforms to Kepler's second law? That is, why is the shape an ellipse? Teacher Support Explain that the pins are the foci and explain what each of the three sections of string represents. Note that the pencil represents a planet and one of the pins represents the sun. You can draw an ellipse as shown by putting a pin at each focus, and then placing a loop of string around a pen and the pins and tracing a line on the paper. Kepler’s Second Law Each planet moves so that an imaginary line drawn from the sun to the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times, as shown in . The shaded regions have equal areas. The time for m to go from A to B is the same as the time to go from C to D and from E to F. The mass m moves fastest when it is closest to M. Kepler’s second law was originally devised for planets orbiting the sun, but it has broader validity. Teacher Support Ask the students to imagine how complicated it would be to describe the motion of the planets mathematically, if it is assumed that Earth is stationary. And yet, people tried to do this for hundreds of years, while overlooking the simple explanation that all planets circle the sun. [OL] Ask students to use this figure to understand why planets and comets travel faster when they are closer to the sun. Explain that time intervals and areas are constant, but both velocity and distance from the sun vary. Note that while, for historical reasons, Kepler’s laws are stated for planets orbiting the sun, they are actually valid for all bodies satisfying the two previously stated conditions. Kepler’s Third Law The ratio of the periods squared of any two planets around the sun is equal to the ratio of their average distances from the sun cubed. In equation form, this is T 1 2 T 2 2 = r 1 3 r 2 3 , where T is the period (time for one orbit) and r is the average distance (also called orbital radius). This equation is valid only for comparing two small masses orbiting a single large mass. Most importantly, this is only a descriptive equation; it gives no information about the cause of the equality. Teacher Support [BL] See if students can rearrange this equation to solve for any one of the variables when the other three are known. [AL] Show a solution for one of the periods T or radii r and ask students to interpret the fractional powers on the right hand side of the equation. [OL] Emphasize that this approach only works for two satellites orbiting the same parent body. The parent body must be the same because r 2 / T 2 = GM/ (4 π 2 ) and M is the mass of the parent body. If M changes, the ratio r3/T2 also changes. History: Ptolemy vs. Copernicus Before the discoveries of Kepler, Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, and others, the solar system was thought to revolve around Earth as shown in (a). This is called the Ptolemaic model, named for the Greek philosopher Ptolemy who lived in the second century AD. The Ptolemaic model is characterized by a list of facts for the motions of planets, with no explanation of cause and effect. There tended to be a different rule for each heavenly body and a general lack of simplicity. (b) represents the modern or Copernican model. In this model, a small set of rules and a single underlying force explain not only all planetary motion in the solar system, but also all other situations involving gravity. The breadth and simplicity of the laws of physics are compelling. (a) The Ptolemaic model of the universe has Earth at the center with the moon, the planets, the sun, and the stars revolving about it in complex circular paths. This geocentric (Earth-centered) model, which can be made progressively more accurate by adding more circles, is purely descriptive, containing no hints about the causes of these motions. (b) The Copernican heliocentric (sun-centered) model is a simpler and more accurate model.Nicolaus Copernicus (1473–1543) first had the idea that the planets circle the sun, in about 1514. It took him almost 20 years to work out the mathematical details for his model. He waited another 10 years or so to publish his work. It is thought he hesitated because he was afraid people would make fun of his theory. Actually, the reaction of many people was more one of fear and anger. Many people felt the Copernican model threatened their basic belief system. About 100 years later, the astronomer Galileo was put under house arrest for providing evidence that planets, including Earth, orbited the sun. In all, it took almost 300 years for everyone to admit that Copernicus had been right all along. Explain why Earth does actually appear to be the center of the solar system. Earth appears to be the center of the solar system because Earth is at the center of the universe, and everything revolves around it in a circular orbit. Earth appears to be the center of the solar system because, in the reference frame of Earth, the sun, moon, and planets all appear to move across the sky as if they were circling Earth. Earth appears to be at the center of the solar system because Earth is at the center of the solar system and all the heavenly bodies revolve around it. Earth appears to be at the center of the solar system because Earth is located at one of the foci of the elliptical orbit of the sun, moon, and other planets. Teacher Support Introduce the historical debate around the geocentric versus the heliocentric view of the universe. Stress how controversial this debate was at the time. Explain that this was important to people because their world view and cultural beliefs were at stake. Acceleration This simulation allows you to create your own solar system so that you can see how changing distances and masses determines the orbits of planets. Click Help for instructions. Teacher Support Give the students ample time to manipulate this animation. It may take some time to get the parameters adjusted so that they can see how mass and eccentricity affect the orbit. Initially, the planet is likely to disappear off the screen or crash into the sun. Calculations Related to Kepler’s Laws of Planetary Motion Kepler’s First Law Refer back to (a). Notice which distances are constant. The foci are fixed, so distance f 1 f 2 ¯ is a constant. The definition of an ellipse states that the sum of the distances f 1 m ¯ + m f 2 ¯ is also constant. These two facts taken together mean that the perimeter of triangle Δ f 1 m f 2 must also be constant. Knowledge of these constants will help you determine positions and distances of objects in a system that includes one object orbiting another. Kepler’s Second Law Refer back to . The second law says that the segments have equal area and that it takes equal time to sweep through each segment. That is, the time it takes to travel from A to B equals the time it takes to travel from C to D, and so forth. Velocity v equals distance d divided by time t: v=d/t . Then, t=d/v , so distance divided by velocity is also a constant. For example, if we know the average velocity of Earth on June 21 and December 21, we can compare the distance Earth travels on those days.The degree of elongation of an elliptical orbit is called its eccentricity (e). Eccentricity is calculated by dividing the distance f from the center of an ellipse to one of the foci by half the long axis a. (e)=f/a When e=0 , the ellipse is a circle. The area of an ellipse is given by A=πab , where b is half the short axis. If you know the axes of Earth’s orbit and the area Earth sweeps out in a given period of time, you can calculate the fraction of the year that has elapsed. Teacher Support [OL] Review the definitions of major and minor axes, semi-major and semi-minor axes, and distance f. The major axis is the length of the ellipse and passes through both foci. The minor axis is the width of the ellipse and is perpendicular to the major axis. The semi-major and semi-minor axes are half of the major and minor axes, respectively. Kepler’s First Law At its closest approach, a moon comes within 200,000 km of the planet it orbits. At that point, the moon is 300,000 km from the other focus of its orbit, f2. The planet is focus f1 of the moon’s elliptical orbit. How far is the moon from the planet when it is 260,000 km from f2? Strategy Show and label the ellipse that is the orbit in your solution. Picture the triangle f1mf2 collapsed along the major axis and add up the lengths of the three sides. Find the length of the unknown side of the triangle when the moon is 260,000 km from f2. Solution Perimeter of f 1 m f 2 =200,000km+100,000km+300,000km=600,000km. m f 1 =600,000km−(100,000km+260,000km)=240,000km. Discussion The perimeter of triangle f1mf2 must be constant because the distance between the foci does not change and Kepler’s first law says the orbit is an ellipse. For any ellipse, the sum of the two sides of the triangle, which are f1m and mf2, is constant. Teacher Support Walk the students through the process of mentally collapsing the f1mf2 at the end of the major axis to reveal what the three sides of the triangle f1mf2 are equal to. Picture the sections of the string as the pencil approaches the major axis. This distance f1f2 remains constant, f1m is the distance from f1 to the end of the major axis, and mf2 is f1m + f1f2. [OL] Have students relate eccentricity, distance between foci, and shape of orbit. [AL] Ask for examples of orbits with high eccentricity (comets, Pluto) and low eccentricity (moon, Earth). Kepler’s Second Law shows the major and minor axes of an ellipse. The semi-major and semi-minor axes are half of these, respectively. The major axis is the length of the ellipse, and the minor axis is the width of the ellipse. The semi-major axis is half the major axis, and the semi-minor axis is half the minor axis.Earth’s orbit is very slightly elliptical, with a semi-major axis of 1.49598 × 108 km and a semi-minor axis of 1.49577 × 108 km. If Earth’s period is 365.26 days, what area does an Earth-to-sun line sweep past in one day? Strategy Each day, Earth sweeps past an equal-sized area, so we divide the total area by the number of days in a year to find the area swept past in one day. For total area use A=πab . Calculate A, the area inside Earth’s orbit and divide by the number of days in a year (i.e., its period). Solution area per day = total area total number of days = πab 365 d = π( 1.496× 10 8 km )( 1.496× 10 3 km ) 365 d = 1.93× 10 14 km 2 /d The area swept out in one day is thus 1.93× 10 14 km 2 . Discussion The answer is based on Kepler’s law, which states that a line from a planet to the sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times. Teacher Support Explain that this formula is easy to remember because it is similar to A=π r 2 . Discuss Earth’s eccentricity. Compare it with that of other planets, asteroids, or comets to further emphasize what defines a planet. Note that Earth has one of the least eccentric orbits and Mercury has the most eccentric orbit of the planets. [BL]Have the students memorized the value of π? [OL][AL]What is the formula when a = b? Is the formula familiar? [OL]Can the student verify this statement by rearranging the equation? Kepler’s Third Law Kepler’s third law states that the ratio of the squares of the periods of any two planets (T1, T2) is equal to the ratio of the cubes of their average orbital distance from the sun (r1, r2). Mathematically, this is represented by T 1 2 T 2 2 = r 1 3 r 2 3 . From this equation, it follows that the ratio r3/T2 is the same for all planets in the solar system. Later we will see how the work of Newton leads to a value for this constant. Kepler’s Third Law Given that the moon orbits Earth each 27.3 days and that it is an average distance of 3.84× 10 8 m from the center of Earth, calculate the period of an artificial satellite orbiting at an average altitude of 1,500 km above Earth’s surface. Strategy The period, or time for one orbit, is related to the radius of the orbit by Kepler’s third law, given in mathematical form by T 1 2 T 2 2 = r 1 3 r 2 3 . Let us use the subscript 1 for the moon and the subscript 2 for the satellite. We are asked to find T2. The given information tells us that the orbital radius of the moon is r 1 =3.84× 10 8 m , and that the period of the moon is T 1 =27.3days . The height of the artificial satellite above Earth’s surface is given, so to get the distance r2 from the center of Earth we must add the height to the radius of Earth (6380 km). This gives r 2 =1500km+6380km=7880km . Now all quantities are known, so T2 can be found. Solution To solve for T2, we cross-multiply and take the square root, yielding T 2 2 = T 1 2 ( r 2 r 1 ) 3 ; T 2 = T 1 ( r 2 r 1 ) 3 2 T 2 =(27.3 d)( 24.0 h d ) ( 7880 km 3.84× 10 5 km ) 3 2 =1.93 h. Discussion This is a reasonable period for a satellite in a fairly low orbit. It is interesting that any satellite at this altitude will complete one orbit in the same amount of time. Teacher Support Remind the students that this only works when the satellites are small compared to the parent object and when both satellites orbit the same parent object. Practice Problems A planet with no axial tilt is located in another solar system. It circles its sun in a very elliptical orbit so that the temperature varies greatly throughout the year. If the year there has 612 days and the inhabitants celebrate the coldest day on day 1 of their calendar, when is the warmest day? Day 1 Day 153 Day 306 Day 459 Check Your Understanding True or false—According to Keplers laws of planetary motion, a satellite increases its speed as it approaches its parent body and decreases its speed as it moves away from the parent body. True False Teacher Support Use the Check Your Answers questions to assess whether students master the learning objectives for this section. If students are struggling with a specific objective, the Check Your Answers will help identify which objective is causing the problem and direct students to the relevant content. Section Summary All satellites follow elliptical orbits. The line from the satellite to the parent body sweeps out equal areas in equal time. The radius cubed divided by the period squared is a constant for all satellites orbiting the same parent body. Key Equations Kepler’s third law T 1 2 T 2 2 = r 1 3 r 2 3 eccentricity e= f a area of an ellipse A=πab semi-major axis of an ellipse a= ( r a + r p )/2 semi-minor axis of an ellipse b= r a r p Concept Items A circle is a special case of an ellipse. Explain how a circle is different from other ellipses. The foci of a circle are at the same point and are located at the center of the circle. The foci of a circle are at the same point and are located at the circumference of the circle. The foci of a circle are at the same point and are located outside of the circle. The foci of a circle are at the same point and are located anywhere on the diameter, except on its midpoint. Comets have very elongated elliptical orbits with the sun at one focus. Using Kepler's Law, explain why a comet travels much faster near the sun than it does at the other end of the orbit. Because the satellite sweeps out equal areas in equal times Because the satellite sweeps out unequal areas in equal times Because the satellite is at the other focus of the ellipse Because the square of the period of the satellite is proportional to the cube of its average distance from the sun True or False—A planet-satellite system must be isolated from other massive objects to follow Keplers laws of planetary motion.

The student knows and applies the laws governing motion in a variety of situations. The student is expected to: (D) calculate the effect of forces on objects, including the law of inertia, the relationship between force and acceleration, and the nature of force pairs between objects; (5) Science concepts. The student knows the nature of forces in the physical world. The student is expected to: (A) research and describe the historical development of the concepts of gravitational, electromagnetic, weak nuclear, and strong nuclear forces; (B) describe and calculate how the magnitude of the gravitational force between two objects depends on their masses and the distance between their centers. Section Key Terms Einstein’s theory of general relativity gravitational constant Newton’s universal law of gravitation Teacher Support In this section, students will apply Newton’s law of universal gravitation to objects close at hand and far off in the depths of the solar system. [BL][OL] Compare the contributions of Kepler, Newton, and Einstein. Place them historically with dates. [AL] Ask if anyone knows the difference between special relativity and general relativity. Special relativity is a theory of spacetime and applies to observers moving at constant velocity. General relativity is a theory of gravity and applies to observers that are accelerating. General relativity is broader and includes special relativity, which was published first. Concepts Related to Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation Sir Isaac Newton was the first scientist to precisely define the gravitational force, and to show that it could explain both falling bodies and astronomical motions. See . But Newton was not the first to suspect that the same force caused both our weight and the motion of planets. His forerunner, Galileo Galilei, had contended that falling bodies and planetary motions had the same cause. Some of Newton’s contemporaries, such as Robert Hooke, Christopher Wren, and Edmund Halley, had also made some progress toward understanding gravitation. But Newton was the first to propose an exact mathematical form and to use that form to show that the motion of heavenly bodies should be conic sections—circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas. This theoretical prediction was a major triumph. It had been known for some time that moons, planets, and comets follow such paths, but no one had been able to propose an explanation of the mechanism that caused them to follow these paths and not others. The popular legend that Newton suddenly discovered the law of universal gravitation when an apple fell from a tree and hit him on the head has an element of truth in it. A more probable account is that he was walking through an orchard and wondered why all the apples fell in the same direction with the same acceleration. Great importance is attached to it because Newton’s universal law of gravitation and his laws of motion answered very old questions about nature and gave tremendous support to the notion of underlying simplicity and unity in nature. Scientists still expect underlying simplicity to emerge from their ongoing inquiries into nature. Teacher Support [BL][OL]Ask students if it really is obvious why all things fall straight down. Ask them to back up their reasons. Ask if the name Halley rings a bell. [OL][AL]Ask if anyone thinks it is strange or even mysterious that a force can act at a distance across empty space. Ask the students to compare and contrast gravitational force with magnetic and electrostatic forces. Note how much force at a distance is like magic or having superpowers. The gravitational force is relatively simple. It is always attractive, and it depends only on the masses involved and the distance between them. Expressed in modern language, Newton’s universal law of gravitation states that every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force that is directed along a line joining them. The force is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This attraction is illustrated by . Gravitational attraction is along a line joining the centers of mass (CM) of the two bodies. The magnitude of the force on each body is the same, consistent with Newton’s third law (action-reaction).For two bodies having masses m and M with a distance r between their centers of mass, the equation for Newton’s universal law of gravitation is F=G mM r 2 where F is the magnitude of the gravitational force and G is a proportionality factor called the gravitational constant. G is a universal constant, meaning that it is thought to be the same everywhere in the universe. It has been measured experimentally to be G=6.673× 10 −11 N⋅ m 2 /kg 2 .If a person has a mass of 60.0 kg, what would be the force of gravitational attraction on him at Earth’s surface? G is given above, Earth’s mass M is 5.97 × 1024 kg, and the radius r of Earth is 6.38 × 106 m. Putting these values into Newton’s universal law of gravitation gives F=G mM r 2 =( 6.673× 10 −11 N⋅ m 2 kg 2 )( ( 60.0 kg )( 5.97× 10 24 kg ) ( 6.38× 10 6 m ) 2 )=584 N We can check this result with the relationship: F=mg=(60kg)(9.8 m/s 2 )=588N You may remember that g, the acceleration due to gravity, is another important constant related to gravity. By substituting g for a in the equation for Newton’s second law of motion we get F=mg . Combining this with the equation for universal gravitation gives mg=G mM r 2 Cancelling the mass m on both sides of the equation and filling in the values for the gravitational constant and mass and radius of the Earth, gives the value of g, which may look familiar. g=G M r 2 =( 6.67× 10 −11 N⋅ m 2 kg 2 )( 5.98× 10 24 kg ( 6.38× 10 6 m ) 2 )=9.80 m/s 2 This is a good point to recall the difference between mass and weight. Mass is the amount of matter in an object; weight is the force of attraction between the mass within two objects. Weight can change because g is different on every moon and planet. An object’s mass m does not change but its weight mg can. Teacher Support [BL][OL]Be sure no one is confusing G with g.[AL]Ask if anyone can explain why G is a universal constant that applies anywhere in the universe. Have them discuss the idea that the laws of physics are the same everywhere and that, at one time, people were not so sure about this. Emphasize that g is not a universal constant. Gravity and Orbits Move the sun, Earth, moon and space station in this simulation to see how it affects their gravitational forces and orbital paths. Visualize the sizes and distances between different heavenly bodies. Turn off gravity to see what would happen without it! Teacher Support This is a good animation of the Earth-Moon-Sun system. Have the students try all of the buttons. This will show the paths of the Earth and the moon separately and together. Explain the gravitational force and velocity vectors. Point out the interesting shape of the moon’s path around the sun. Explain that the velocity vector of the moon changes because sometimes the moon is traveling in the direction of Earth’s orbit and sometimes it is traveling in the opposite direction. Take-Home Experiment: Falling Objects In this activity you will study the effects of mass and air resistance on the acceleration of falling objects. Make predictions (hypotheses) about the outcome of this experiment. Write them down to compare later with results. Four sheets of 8-1/2 ×11 -inch paper Procedure Take four identical pieces of paper. Crumple one up into a small ball. Leave one uncrumpled. Take the other two and crumple them up together, so that they make a ball of exactly twice the mass of the other crumpled ball. Now compare which ball of paper lands first when dropped simultaneously from the same height. Compare crumpled one-paper ball with crumpled two-paper ball. Compare crumpled one-paper ball with uncrumpled paper. Teacher Support Ask for predictions (hypotheses) about the outcome of this experiment. Have the students write them down to compare later with results. It is possible to derive Kepler’s third law from Newton’s law of universal gravitation. Applying Newton’s second law of motion to angular motion gives an expression for centripetal force, which can be equated to the expression for force in the universal gravitation equation. This expression can be manipulated to produce the equation for Kepler’s third law. We saw earlier that the expression r3/T2 is a constant for satellites orbiting the same massive object. The derivation of Kepler’s third law from Newton’s law of universal gravitation and Newton’s second law of motion yields that constant: r 3 T 2 = GM 4 π 2 where M is the mass of the central body about which the satellites orbit (for example, the sun in our solar system). The usefulness of this equation will be seen later. Teacher Support [OL]This equation illustrates the difference between Kepler’s and Newton’s work. Ask the students to explain why this is so. [AL]Ask the students what the attraction would be between two 10 kg balls separated by a distance of 1.0 m. Could they feel it? Later, ask them to calculate it after they have done some similar calculations. Solution: F=G mM r 2 =( 6.67× 10 −11 N⋅ m 2 kg 2 )( 10 kg×10 kg ( 1 m ) 2 )=6.67× 10 −9 N The universal gravitational constant G is determined experimentally. This determination was first done accurately in 1798 by English scientist Henry Cavendish (1731–1810), more than 100 years after Newton published his universal law of gravitation. The measurement of G is very basic and important because it determines the strength of one of the four forces in nature. Cavendish’s experiment was very difficult because he measured the tiny gravitational attraction between two ordinary-sized masses (tens of kilograms at most) by using an apparatus like that in . Remarkably, his value for G differs by less than 1% from the modern value. Cavendish used an apparatus like this to measure the gravitational attraction between two suspended spheres (m) and two spheres on a stand (M) by observing the amount of torsion (twisting) created in the fiber. The distance between the masses can be varied to check the dependence of the force on distance. Modern experiments of this type continue to explore gravity. Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity Einstein’s theory of general relativity explained some interesting properties of gravity not covered by Newton’s theory. Einstein based his theory on the postulate that acceleration and gravity have the same effect and cannot be distinguished from each other. He concluded that light must fall in both a gravitational field and in an accelerating reference frame. shows this effect (greatly exaggerated) in an accelerating elevator. In (a), the elevator accelerates upward in zero gravity. In (b), the room is not accelerating but is subject to gravity. The effect on light is the same: it “falls” downward in both situations. The person in the elevator cannot tell whether the elevator is accelerating in zero gravity or is stationary and subject to gravity. Thus, gravity affects the path of light, even though we think of gravity as acting between masses, while photons are massless. Teacher Support [BL][OL]Ask the students to discuss the postulate. Can they relate the identity of gravity and acceleration to experience? (a) A beam of light emerges from a flashlight in an upward-accelerating elevator. Since the elevator moves up during the time the light takes to reach the wall, the beam strikes lower than it would if the elevator were not accelerated. (b) Gravity must have the same effect on light, since it is not possible to tell whether the elevator is accelerating upward or is stationary and acted upon by gravity.Einstein’s theory of general relativity got its first verification in 1919 when starlight passing near the sun was observed during a solar eclipse. (See .) During an eclipse, the sky is darkened and we can briefly see stars. Those on a line of sight nearest the sun should have a shift in their apparent positions. Not only was this shift observed, but it agreed with Einstein’s predictions well within experimental uncertainties. This discovery created a scientific and public sensation. Einstein was now a folk hero as well as a very great scientist. The bending of light by matter is equivalent to a bending of space itself, with light following the curve. This is another radical change in our concept of space and time. It is also another connection that any particle with mass or energy (e.g., massless photons) is affected by gravity. This schematic shows how light passing near a massive body like the sun is curved toward it. The light that reaches the Earth then seems to be coming from different locations than the known positions of the originating stars. Not only was this effect observed, but the amount of bending was precisely what Einstein predicted in his general theory of relativity.To summarize the two views of gravity, Newton envisioned gravity as a tug of war along the line connecting any two objects in the universe. In contrast, Einstein envisioned gravity as a bending of space-time by mass. NASA gravity probe B NASA’s Gravity Probe B (GP-B) mission has confirmed two key predictions derived from Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity. The probe, shown in was launched in 2004. It carried four ultra-precise gyroscopes designed to measure two effects hypothesized by Einstein’s theory: The geodetic effect, which is the warping of space and time by the gravitational field of a massive body (in this case, Earth) The frame-dragging effect, which is the amount by which a spinning object pulls space and time with it as it rotates Artist concept of Gravity Probe B spacecraft in orbit around the Earth. (credit: NASA/MSFC)Both effects were measured with unprecedented precision. This was done by pointing the gyroscopes at a single star while orbiting Earth in a polar orbit. As predicted by relativity theory, the gyroscopes experienced very small, but measureable, changes in the direction of their spin caused by the pull of Earth’s gravity. The principle investigator suggested imagining Earth spinning in honey. As Earth rotates it drags space and time with it as it would a surrounding sea of honey. Teacher Support Explain that it is very exciting when a prediction of relativity theory is tested successfully. Some of the predictions were in doubt because they sounded so bizarre. Calculations Based on Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation When performing calculations using the equations in this chapter, use units of kilograms for mass, meters for distances, newtons for force, and seconds for time. The mass of an object is constant, but its weight varies with the strength of the gravitational field. This means the value of g varies from place to place in the universe. The relationship between force, mass, and acceleration from the second law of motion can be written in terms of g. F=ma=mg In this case, the force is the weight of the object, which is caused by the gravitational attraction of the planet or moon on which the object is located. We can use this expression to compare weights of an object on different moons and planets. Teacher Support [BL] Check to make sure students are clear about the distinction between mass and weight. [OL] Recall the antics of astronauts of on the moon performed to illustrate the effect of a different value for g. Mass and Weight Clarification This video shows the mathematical basis of the relationship between mass and weight. The distinction between mass and weight are clearly explained. The mathematical relationship between mass and weight are shown mathematically in terms of the equation for Newton’s law of universal gravitation and in terms of his second law of motion. Would you have the same mass on the moon as you do on Earth? Would you have the same weight? You would weigh more on the moon than on Earth because gravity on the moon is stronger than gravity on Earth. You would weigh less on the moon than on Earth because gravity on the moon is weaker than gravity on Earth. You would weigh less on the moon than on Earth because gravity on the moon is stronger than gravity on Earth. You would weigh more on the moon than on Earth because gravity on the moon is weaker than gravity on Earth. Teacher Support This may be a rather long-winded explanation of the mass-weight distinction, but it should drive home the point. Two equations involving the gravitational constant, G, are often useful. The first is Newton’s equation, F=G mM r 2 . Several of the values in this equation are either constants or easily obtainable. F is often the weight of an object on the surface of a large object with mass M, which is usually known. The mass of the smaller object, m, is often known, and G is a universal constant with the same value anywhere in the universe. This equation can be used to solve problems involving an object on or orbiting Earth or other massive celestial object. Sometimes it is helpful to equate the right-hand side of the equation to mg and cancel the m on both sides.The equation r 3 T 2 = GM 4 π 2 is also useful for problems involving objects in orbit. Note that there is no need to know the mass of the object. Often, we know the radius r or the period T and want to find the other. If these are both known, we can use the equation to calculate the mass of a planet or star. Mass and Weight Clarification This video demonstrates calculations involving Newton’s universal law of gravitation. Teacher Support This video is a thorough demonstration of many of the calculations to be learned in this subsection. Change in g The value of g on the planet Mars is 3.71 m/s2. If you have a mass of 60.0 kg on Earth, what would be your mass on Mars? What would be your weight on Mars? Strategy Weight equals acceleration due to gravity times mass: W=mg . An object’s mass is constant. Call acceleration due to gravity on Mars gM and weight on Mars WM. Solution Mass on Mars would be the same, 60 kg. W M =m g M =( 60.0kg )( 3.71 m/s 2 )=223N Discussion The value of g on any planet depends on the mass of the planet and the distance from its center. If the material below the surface varies from point to point, the value of g will also vary slightly. Teacher Support This is a typical mass-weight calculation. Earth’s g at the Moon Find the acceleration due to Earth’s gravity at the distance of the moon. G = 6.67 × 10 –11 N · m 2 /kg 2 Earth-moon distance = 3.84 × 10 8 m Earth’s mass = 5.98 × 10 24 kg Express the force of gravity in terms of g. F = W = ma = mg Combine with the equation for universal gravitation. mg=mG M r 2 Solution Cancel m and substitute. g=G M r 2 =( 6.67× 10 −11 N⋅ m 2 kg 2 )( 5.98× 10 24 kg ( 3.84× 10 8 m ) 2 )=2.70× 10 −3 m/s 2 Discussion The value of g for the moon is 1.62 m/s2. Comparing this value to the answer, we see that Earth’s gravitational influence on an object on the moon’s surface would be insignificant. Teacher Support [BL][OL] Review the meanings of all the symbols in these equations: F, G, m, M, r, T, and π .[OL][AL] Have the students memorize the values of G, g, and π to three significant figures.

Section Summary Newton’s law of universal gravitation provides a mathematical basis for gravitational force and Kepler’s laws of planetary motion. Einstein’s theory of general relativity shows that gravitational fields change the path of light and warp space and time. An object’s mass is constant, but its weight changes when acceleration due to gravity, g, changes.

Critical Thinking Rhea, with a radius of 7.63×105 m, is the second-largest moon of the planet Saturn.

The orbit of the planet Mercury has a period of 88.0 days and an average radius of 5.791×1010 m. What is the mass of the sun? 3.43×1019 kg 1.99×1030 kg 2.56×1029 kg 1.48×1040 kg Performance Task Design an experiment to test whether magnetic force is inversely proportional to the square of distance. Gravitational, magnetic, and electrical fields all act at a distance, but do they all follow the inverse square law? One difference in the forces related to these fields is that gravity is only attractive, but the other two can repel as well. In general, the inverse square law says that force F equals a constant C divided by the distance between objects, d, squared: F=C/ d 2 . Incorporate these materials into your design: Two strong, permanent bar magnets A spring scale that can measure small forces A short ruler calibrated in millimeters Use the magnets to study the relationship between attractive force and distance. What will be the independent variable? What will be the dependent variable? How will you measure each of these variables? If you plot the independent variable versus the dependent variable and the inverse square law is upheld, will the plot be a straight line? Explain. Which plot would be a straight line if the inverse square law were upheld? Magnets must be strong, such as neodymium magnets or cow magnets (ask a veterinarian). Suggest that they could either measure distance versus attractive force or repulsive force. Attractive force at various distances can be measured with the spring scale. Repulsive force could be measured by dropping the magnets into a transparent tube oriented so that they repel each other. The distance will be the distance between the magnets. Ask what the force will be. Ask how they could change the force and thereby change the distance. Test Prep Multiple Choice What did the Cavendish experiment measure? The mass of Earth The gravitational constant Acceleration due to gravity The eccentricity of Earths orbit Test Prep Short Answer Newtons third law of motion says that, for every action force, there is a reaction force equal in magnitude but that acts in the opposite direction. Apply this law to gravitational forces acting between the Washington Monument and Earth. The monument is attracted to Earth with a force equal to its weight, and Earth is attracted to the monument with a force equal to Earths weight. The situation can be represented with two force vectors of unequal magnitude and pointing in the same direction. The monument is attracted to Earth with a force equal to its weight, and Earth is attracted to the monument with a force equal to Earths weight. The situation can be represented with two force vectors of unequal magnitude but pointing in opposite directions. The monument is attracted to Earth with a force equal to its weight, and Earth is attracted to the monument with an equal force. The situation can be represented with two force vectors of equal magnitude and pointing in the same direction. The monument is attracted to Earth with a force equal to its weight, and Earth is attracted to the monument with an equal force. The situation can be represented with two force vectors of equal magnitude but pointing in opposite directions. True or false—Gravitational force is the attraction of the mass of one object to the mass of another. Light, either as a particle or a wave, has no rest mass. Despite this fact gravity bends a beam of light. True False Test Prep Extended Response It took scientists a long time to arrive at the understanding of gravity as explained by Galileo and Newton. They were hindered by two ideas that seemed like common sense but were serious misconceptions. First was the fact that heavier things fall faster than light things. Second, it was believed impossible that forces could act at a distance. Explain why these ideas persisted and why they prevented advances. Heavier things fall faster than light things if they have less surface area and greater mass density. In the Renaissance and before, forces that acted at a distance were considered impossible, so people were skeptical about scientific theories that invoked such forces. Heavier things fall faster than light things because they have greater surface area and less mass density. In the Renaissance and before, forces that act at a distance were considered impossible, so people were skeptical about scientific theories that invoked such forces. Heavier things fall faster than light things because they have less surface area and greater mass density. In the Renaissance and before, forces that act at a distance were considered impossible, so people were quick to accept scientific theories that invoked such forces. Heavier things fall faster than light things because they have larger surface area and less mass density. In the Renaissance and before, forces that act at a distance were considered impossible because of people’s faith in scientific theories. The masses of Earth and the moon are 5.97×1024 kg and 7.35×1022 kg, respectively. The distance from Earth to the moon is 3.80×105 km.

Would it hurt more if a heavier person collided into you or a faster person? Tell students that in this chapter they will learn about momentum, its relation to force and about collisions. We know from everyday use of the word momentum that it is a tendency to continue on course in the same direction. Newscasters speak of sports teams or politicians gaining, losing, or maintaining the momentum to win. As we learned when studying about inertia, which is Newton's first law of motion, every object or system has inertia—that is, a tendency for an object in motion to remain in motion or an object at rest to remain at rest. Mass is a useful variable that lets us quantify inertia. Momentum is mass in motion. Momentum is important because it is conserved in isolated systems; this fact is convenient for solving problems where objects collide. The magnitude of momentum grows with greater mass and/or speed. For example, look at the football players in the photograph (). They collide and fall to the ground. During their collisions, momentum will play a large part. In this chapter, we will learn about momentum, the different types of collisions, and how to use momentum equations to solve collision problems.

Section Key Terms change in momentum impulse impulse–momentum theorem linear momentum Teacher Support [BL][OL] Review inertia and Newton’s laws of motion. [AL] Start a discussion about movement and collision. Using the example of football players, point out that both the mass and the velocity of an object are important considerations in determining the impact of collisions. The direction as well as the magnitude of velocity is very important. Momentum, Impulse, and the Impulse-Momentum Theorem Linear momentum is the product of a system’s mass and its velocity. In equation form, linear momentum p is p=mv . You can see from the equation that momentum is directly proportional to the object’s mass (m) and velocity (v). Therefore, the greater an object’s mass or the greater its velocity, the greater its momentum. A large, fast-moving object has greater momentum than a smaller, slower object. Momentum is a vector and has the same direction as velocity v. Since mass is a scalar, when velocity is in a negative direction (i.e., opposite the direction of motion), the momentum will also be in a negative direction; and when velocity is in a positive direction, momentum will likewise be in a positive direction. The SI unit for momentum is kg m/s. Momentum is so important for understanding motion that it was called the quantity of motion by physicists such as Newton. Force influences momentum, and we can rearrange Newton’s second law of motion to show the relationship between force and momentum. Recall our study of Newton’s second law of motion (Fnet = ma). Newton actually stated his second law of motion in terms of momentum: The net external force equals the change in momentum of a system divided by the time over which it changes. The change in momentum is the difference between the final and initial values of momentum. In equation form, this law is F net = Δp Δt , where Fnet is the net external force, Δp is the change in momentum, and Δt is the change in time. We can solve for Δp by rearranging the equation F net = Δp Δt to be Δp= F net Δt . F net Δt is known as impulse and this equation is known as the impulse-momentum theorem. From the equation, we see that the impulse equals the average net external force multiplied by the time this force acts. It is equal to the change in momentum. The effect of a force on an object depends on how long it acts, as well as the strength of the force. Impulse is a useful concept because it quantifies the effect of a force. A very large force acting for a short time can have a great effect on the momentum of an object, such as the force of a racket hitting a tennis ball. A small force could cause the same change in momentum, but it would have to act for a much longer time. Teacher Support [OL][AL] Explain that a large, fast-moving object has greater momentum than a smaller, slower object. This quality is called momentum. [BL][OL] Review the equation of Newton’s second law of motion. Point out the two different equations for the law. Newton’s Second Law in Terms of MomentumWhen Newton’s second law is expressed in terms of momentum, it can be used for solving problems where mass varies, since Δp=Δ(mv) . In the more traditional form of the law that you are used to working with, mass is assumed to be constant. In fact, this traditional form is a special case of the law, where mass is constant. F net =ma is actually derived from the equation: F net = Δp Δt For the sake of understanding the relationship between Newton’s second law in its two forms, let’s recreate the derivation of F net =ma from F net = Δp Δt by substituting the definitions of acceleration and momentum. The change in momentum Δp is given by Δp=Δ(mv) . If the mass of the system is constant, then Δ(mv)=mΔv . By substituting mΔv for Δp , Newton’s second law of motion becomes F net = Δp Δt = mΔv Δt for a constant mass. Because Δv Δt =a , we can substitute to get the familiar equation F net =ma when the mass of the system is constant. Teacher Support [BL][OL][AL] Show the two different forms of Newton’s second law and how one can be derived from the other. We just showed how F net =ma applies only when the mass of the system is constant. An example of when this formula would not apply would be a moving rocket that burns enough fuel to significantly change the mass of the rocket. In this case, you can use Newton’s second law expressed in terms of momentum to account for the changing mass without having to know anything about the interaction force by the fuel on the rocket. Hand Movement and Impulse In this activity you will experiment with different types of hand motions to gain an intuitive understanding of the relationship between force, time, and impulse. one ball one tub filled with water Procedure: Try catching a ball while giving with the ball, pulling your hands toward your body. Next, try catching a ball while keeping your hands still. Hit water in a tub with your full palm. Your full palm represents a swimmer doing a belly flop. After the water has settled, hit the water again by diving your hand with your fingers first into the water. Your diving hand represents a swimmer doing a dive. Explain what happens in each case and why. Teacher Support [OL][AL] Discuss the impact one feels when one falls or jumps. List the factors that affect this impact. Engineering: Saving Lives Using the Concept of Impulse Cars during the past several decades have gotten much safer. Seat belts play a major role in automobile safety by preventing people from flying into the windshield in the event of a crash. Other safety features, such as airbags, are less visible or obvious, but are also effective at making auto crashes less deadly (see ). Many of these safety features make use of the concept of impulse from physics. Recall that impulse is the net force multiplied by the duration of time of the impact. This was expressed mathematically as Δp= F net Δt . Vehicles have safety features like airbags and seat belts installed. Airbags allow the net force on the occupants in the car to act over a much longer time when there is a sudden stop. The momentum change is the same for an occupant whether an airbag is deployed or not. But the force that brings the occupant to a stop will be much less if it acts over a larger time. By rearranging the equation for impulse to solve for force F net = Δp Δt , you can see how increasing Δt while Δp stays the same will decrease Fnet. This is another example of an inverse relationship. Similarly, a padded dashboard increases the time over which the force of impact acts, thereby reducing the force of impact. Cars today have many plastic components. One advantage of plastics is their lighter weight, which results in better gas mileage. Another advantage is that a car will crumple in a collision, especially in the event of a head-on collision. A longer collision time means the force on the occupants of the car will be less. Deaths during car races decreased dramatically when the rigid frames of racing cars were replaced with parts that could crumple or collapse in the event of an accident. You may have heard the advice to bend your knees when jumping. In this example, a friend dares you to jump off of a park bench onto the ground without bending your knees. You, of course, refuse. Explain to your friend why this would be a foolish thing. Show it using the impulse-momentum theorem. Bending your knees increases the time of the impact, thus decreasing the force. Bending your knees decreases the time of the impact, thus decreasing the force. Bending your knees increases the time of the impact, thus increasing the force. Bending your knees decreases the time of the impact, thus increasing the force. Solving Problems Using the Impulse-Momentum Theorem Teacher Support Talk about the different strategies to be used while solving problems. Make sure that students know the assumptions made in each equation regarding certain quantities being constant or some quantities being negligible. Calculating Momentum: A Football Player and a Football (a) Calculate the momentum of a 110 kg football player running at 8 m/s. (b) Compare the player’s momentum with the momentum of a 0.410 kg football thrown hard at a speed of 25 m/s. Strategy No information is given about the direction of the football player or the football, so we can calculate only the magnitude of the momentum, p. (A symbol in italics represents magnitude.) In both parts of this example, the magnitude of momentum can be calculated directly from the definition of momentum: p=mv Solution for (a) To find the player’s momentum, substitute the known values for the player’s mass and speed into the equation. p player =(110 kg)(8 m/s)=880kg⋅m/s Solution for (b) To find the ball’s momentum, substitute the known values for the ball’s mass and speed into the equation. p ball =(0.410 kg)(25 m/s)=10.25kg⋅m/s The ratio of the player’s momentum to the ball’s momentum is p player p ball = 880 10.3 =85.9. Discussion Although the ball has greater velocity, the player has a much greater mass. Therefore, the momentum of the player is about 86 times greater than the momentum of the football. Calculating Force: Venus Williams’ Racquet During the 2007 French Open, Venus Williams () hit the fastest recorded serve in a premier women’s match, reaching a speed of 58 m/s (209 km/h). What was the average force exerted on the 0.057 kg tennis ball by Williams’ racquet? Assume that the ball’s speed just after impact was 58 m/s, the horizontal velocity before impact is negligible, and that the ball remained in contact with the racquet for 5 ms (milliseconds). Venus Williams playing in the 2013 US Open (Edwin Martinez, Flickr)Strategy Recall that Newton’s second law stated in terms of momentum is F net = Δp Δt . As noted above, when mass is constant, the change in momentum is given by Δp=mΔv=m( v f − v i ) , where vf is the final velocity and vi is the initial velocity. In this example, the velocity just after impact and the change in time are given, so after we solve for Δp , we can use F net = Δp Δt to find the force. Solution To determine the change in momentum, substitute the values for mass and the initial and final velocities into the equation above. Δ p = m( v f − v i ) = ( 0.057 kg )( 58 m/s – 0 m/s ) = 3.306 kg·m/s ≈ 3.3 kg·m/s Now we can find the magnitude of the net external force using F net = Δp Δt F net = Δp Δt = 3.306 5× 10 −3 = 661 N ≈ 660 N. Discussion This quantity was the average force exerted by Venus Williams’ racquet on the tennis ball during its brief impact. This problem could also be solved by first finding the acceleration and then using Fnet = ma, but we would have had to do one more step. In this case, using momentum was a shortcut.

Section Summary Linear momentum, often referenced as momentum for short, is defined as the product of a system’s mass multiplied by its velocity, p = mv. The SI unit for momentum is kg m/s. Newton’s second law of motion in terms of momentum states that the net external force equals the change in momentum of a system divided by the time over which it changes, F net = Δp Δt . Impulse is the average net external force multiplied by the time this force acts, and impulse equals the change in momentum, Δp= F net Δt . Forces are usually not constant over a period of time, so we use the average of the force over the time it acts.

How is net force related to the momentum of the object? Forces are usually constant over a period of time, and net force acting on the object is equal to the rate of change of the momentum.

The student is expected to: (C) calculate the mechanical energy of, power generated within, impulse applied to, and momentum of a physical system (D) demonstrate and apply the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum in one dimension Section Key Terms angular momentum isolated system law of conservation of momentum Teacher Support In this section, students will apply what they have learned about momentum, impulse, and force. [BL][OL] Before students read the section, ask them what they understand by the word conservation. Have they come across it in any other law of physics? Conservation of Momentum It is important we realize that momentum is conserved during collisions, explosions, and other events involving objects in motion. To say that a quantity is conserved means that it is constant throughout the event. In the case of conservation of momentum, the total momentum in the system remains the same before and after the collision. You may have noticed that momentum was not conserved in some of the examples previously presented in this chapter. where forces acting on the objects produced large changes in momentum. Why is this? The systems of interest considered in those problems were not inclusive enough. If the systems were expanded to include more objects, then momentum would in fact be conserved in those sample problems. It is always possible to find a larger system where momentum is conserved, even though momentum changes for individual objects within the system. Teacher Support [OL][AL] Caution students that momentum is only conserved when the entire system affected is taken into account. Explain isolated system. Ask students to give examples of isolated systems. Ask them if these are perfectly isolated. Would it be possible to have perfectly isolated systems on Earth? For example, if a football player runs into the goalpost in the end zone, a force will cause him to bounce backward. His momentum is obviously greatly changed, and considering only the football player, we would find that momentum is not conserved. However, the system can be expanded to contain the entire Earth. Surprisingly, Earth also recoils—conserving momentum—because of the force applied to it through the goalpost. The effect on Earth is not noticeable because it is so much more massive than the player, but the effect is real. Next, consider what happens if the masses of two colliding objects are more similar than the masses of a football player and Earth—in the example shown in of one car bumping into another. Both cars are coasting in the same direction when the lead car, labeled m2, is bumped by the trailing car, labeled m1. The only unbalanced force on each car is the force of the collision, assuming that the effects due to friction are negligible. Car m1 slows down as a result of the collision, losing some momentum, while car m2 speeds up and gains some momentum. If we choose the system to include both cars and assume that friction is negligible, then the momentum of the two-car system should remain constant. Now we will prove that the total momentum of the two-car system does in fact remain constant, and is therefore conserved. Car of mass m1 moving with a velocity of v1 bumps into another car of mass m2 and velocity v2. As a result, the first car slows down to a velocity of v′1 and the second speeds up to a velocity of v′2. The momentum of each car is changed, but the total momentum ptot of the two cars is the same before and after the collision if you assume friction is negligible.Using the impulse-momentum theorem, the change in momentum of car 1 is given by Δ p 1 = F 1 Δt , where F1 is the force on car 1 due to car 2, and Δt is the time the force acts, or the duration of the collision. Similarly, the change in momentum of car 2 is Δ p 2 = F 2 Δt where F2 is the force on car 2 due to car 1, and we assume the duration of the collision Δt is the same for both cars. We know from Newton’s third law of motion that F2 = –F1, and so Δ p 2 =− F 1 Δt=−Δ p 1 . Therefore, the changes in momentum are equal and opposite, and Δ p 1 +Δ p 2 =0 . Because the changes in momentum add to zero, the total momentum of the two-car system is constant. That is, p 1 + p 2 =constant p 1 + p 2 = p ′ 1 + p ′ 2 , where p′1 and p′2 are the momenta of cars 1 and 2 after the collision. This result that momentum is conserved is true not only for this example involving the two cars, but for any system where the net external force is zero, which is known as an isolated system. The law of conservation of momentum states that for an isolated system with any number of objects in it, the total momentum is conserved. In equation form, the law of conservation of momentum for an isolated system is written as p tot =constant or p tot = p ′ tot , where ptot is the total momentum, or the sum of the momenta of the individual objects in the system at a given time, and p′tot is the total momentum some time later. The conservation of momentum principle can be applied to systems as diverse as a comet striking the Earth or a gas containing huge numbers of atoms and molecules. Conservation of momentum appears to be violated only when the net external force is not zero. But another larger system can always be considered in which momentum is conserved by simply including the source of the external force. For example, in the collision of two cars considered above, the two-car system conserves momentum while each one-car system does not. Momenta is the plural form of the word momentum. One object is said to have momentum, but two or more objects are said to have momenta. Angular Momentum in Figure Skating So far we have covered linear momentum, which describes the inertia of objects traveling in a straight line. But we know that many objects in nature have a curved or circular path. Just as linear motion has linear momentum to describe its tendency to move forward, circular motion has the equivalent angular momentum to describe how rotational motion is carried forward. This is similar to how torque is analogous to force, angular acceleration is analogous to translational acceleration, and mr2 is analogous to mass or inertia. You may recall learning that the quantity mr2 is called the rotational inertia or moment of inertia of a point mass m at a distance r from the center of rotation. We already know the equation for linear momentum, p = mv. Since angular momentum is analogous to linear momentum, the moment of inertia (I) is analogous to mass, and angular velocity (ω) is analogous to linear velocity, it makes sense that angular momentum (L) is defined as L=Iω Angular momentum is conserved when the net external torque ( τ ) is zero, just as linear momentum is conserved when the net external force is zero. Figure skaters take advantage of the conservation of angular momentum, likely without even realizing it. In , a figure skater is executing a spin. The net torque on her is very close to zero, because there is relatively little friction between her skates and the ice, and because the friction is exerted very close to the pivot point. Both F and r are small, and so τ is negligibly small. (a) An ice skater is spinning on the tip of her skate with her arms extended. In the next image, (b), her rate of spin increases greatly when she pulls in her arms. Consequently, she can spin for quite some time. She can do something else, too. She can increase her rate of spin by pulling her arms and legs in. Why does pulling her arms and legs in increase her rate of spin? The answer is that her angular momentum is constant, so that L = L′. Expressing this equation in terms of the moment of inertia, Iω= I ′ ω ′ , where the primed quantities refer to conditions after she has pulled in her arms and reduced her moment of inertia. Because I′ is smaller, the angular velocity ω ′ must increase to keep the angular momentum constant. This allows her to spin much faster without exerting any extra torque.A video is also available that shows a real figure skater executing a spin. It discusses the physics of spins in figure skating. Teacher Support You can demonstrate a similar exercise in class using a revolving stool or chair. Ask a student to sit on the stool with outstretched arms, holding some weight in each hand. Rotate the stool and once a good speed is achieved, ask him to bring his hands in close to his body. He will start spinning faster. Based on the equation L = Iω, how would you expect the moment of inertia of an object to affect angular momentum? How would angular velocity affect angular momentum? Large moment of inertia implies large angular momentum, and large angular velocity implies large angular momentum. Large moment of inertia implies small angular momentum, and large angular velocity implies small angular momentum. Large moment of inertia implies large angular momentum, and large angular velocity implies small angular momentum. Large moment of inertia implies small angular momentum, and large angular velocity implies large angular momentum. Check Your Understanding When is momentum said to be conserved?

Section Summary The law of conservation of momentum is written ptot = constant or ptot = p′tot (isolated system), where ptot is the initial total momentum and p′tot is the total momentum some time later.

It hits another stationary ball, which then starts rolling. Considering friction to be negligible, what will happen to the momentum of the first ball? It will decrease. It will increase. It will become zero. It will remain the same. A ball rolling on the floor with momentum p1 collides with a stationary ball and sets it in motion. The momentum of the first ball becomes p'1, and that of the second becomes p'2. The directions of p1, p'1, and p'2 are all the same. Compare the magnitudes of p1 and p'2. Momenta p1 and p'2 are the same in magnitude. The sum of the magnitudes of p1 and p'2 is zero. The magnitude of p1 is greater than that of p'2. The magnitude of p'2 is greater than that of p1. Two cars are moving in the same direction. One car with momentum p1 collides with another, which has momentum p2. Their momenta become p'1 and p'2 respectively. Considering frictional losses, compare (p'1 + p'2 ) with (p1 + p2). The value of (p'1 + p'2 ) is zero. The values of (p1 + p2) and (p'1 + p'2 ) are equal.

The student knows that changes occur within a physical system and applies the laws of conservation of energy and momentum. The student is expected to: (C) calculate the mechanical energy of, power generated within, impulse applied to, and momentum of a physical system; (D) demonstrate and apply the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum in one dimension. Section Key Terms elastic collision inelastic collision point masses recoil Elastic and Inelastic CollisionsWhen objects collide, they can either stick together or bounce off one another, remaining separate. In this section, we’ll cover these two different types of collisions, first in one dimension and then in two dimensions. In an elastic collision, the objects separate after impact and don’t lose any of their kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is the energy of motion and is covered in detail elsewhere. The law of conservation of momentum is very useful here, and it can be used whenever the net external force on a system is zero. shows an elastic collision where momentum is conserved. The diagram shows a one-dimensional elastic collision between two objects. An animation of an elastic collision between balls can be seen by watching this video. It replicates the elastic collisions between balls of varying masses. Perfectly elastic collisions can happen only with subatomic particles. Everyday observable examples of perfectly elastic collisions don’t exist—some kinetic energy is always lost, as it is converted into heat transfer due to friction. However, collisions between everyday objects are almost perfectly elastic when they occur with objects and surfaces that are nearly frictionless, such as with two steel blocks on ice. Now, to solve problems involving one-dimensional elastic collisions between two objects, we can use the equation for conservation of momentum. First, the equation for conservation of momentum for two objects in a one-dimensional collision is p 1 + p 2 = p ′ 1 + p ′ 2 ( F net =0) . Substituting the definition of momentum p = mv for each initial and final momentum, we get m 1 v 1 + m 2 v 2 = m 1 v ′ 1 + m 2 v ′ 2 , where the primes (') indicate values after the collision; In some texts, you may see i for initial (before collision) and f for final (after collision). The equation assumes that the mass of each object does not change during the collision. Momentum: Ice Skater Throws a Ball This video covers an elastic collision problem in which we find the recoil velocity of an ice skater who throws a ball straight forward. To clarify, Sal is using the equation m ball V ball + m skater V skater = m ball v ′ ball + m skater v ′ skater . Now, let us turn to the second type of collision. An inelastic collision is one in which kinetic energy is not conserved. A perfectly inelastic collision (also sometimes called completely or maximally inelastic) is one in which objects stick together after impact, and the maximum amount of kinetic energy is lost. This lack of conservation means that the forces between colliding objects may convert kinetic energy to other forms of energy, such as potential energy or thermal energy. The concepts of energy are discussed more thoroughly elsewhere. For inelastic collisions, kinetic energy may be lost in the form of heat. shows an example of an inelastic collision. Two objects that have equal masses head toward each other at equal speeds and then stick together. The two objects come to rest after sticking together, conserving momentum but not kinetic energy after they collide. Some of the energy of motion gets converted to thermal energy, or heat. A one-dimensional inelastic collision between two objects. Momentum is conserved, but kinetic energy is not conserved. (a) Two objects of equal mass initially head directly toward each other at the same speed. (b) The objects stick together, creating a perfectly inelastic collision. In the case shown in this figure, the combined objects stop; This is not true for all inelastic collisions. Since the two objects stick together after colliding, they move together at the same speed. This lets us simplify the conservation of momentum equation from m 1 v 1 + m 2 v 2 = m 1 v ′ 1 + m 2 v ′ 2 to m 1 v 1 + m 2 v 2 = ( m 1 + m 2 ) v ′ for inelastic collisions, where v′ is the final velocity for both objects as they are stuck together, either in motion or at rest. Teacher Support [BL][OL] Review the concept of internal energy. Ask students what they understand by the words elastic and inelastic.[AL] Start a discussion about collisions. Ask students to give examples of elastic and inelastic collisions. Introduction to Momentum This video reviews the definitions of momentum and impulse. It also covers an example of using conservation of momentum to solve a problem involving an inelastic collision between a car with constant velocity and a stationary truck. Note that Sal accidentally gives the unit for impulse as Joules; it is actually N ⋅ s or k ⋅ gm/s. How would the final velocity of the car-plus-truck system change if the truck had some initial velocity moving in the same direction as the car? What if the truck were moving in the opposite direction of the car initially? Why? If the truck was initially moving in the same direction as the car, the final velocity would be greater. If the truck was initially moving in the opposite direction of the car, the final velocity would be smaller. If the truck was initially moving in the same direction as the car, the final velocity would be smaller. If the truck was initially moving in the opposite direction of the car, the final velocity would be greater. The direction in which the truck was initially moving would not matter. If the truck was initially moving in either direction, the final velocity would be smaller. The direction in which the truck was initially moving would not matter. If the truck was initially moving in either direction, the final velocity would be greater. Ice Cubes and Elastic Collisions In this activity, you will observe an elastic collision by sliding an ice cube into another ice cube on a smooth surface, so that a negligible amount of energy is converted to heat. Several ice cubes (The ice must be in the form of cubes.) A smooth surface Procedure Find a few ice cubes that are about the same size and a smooth kitchen tabletop or a table with a glass top. Place the ice cubes on the surface several centimeters away from each other. Flick one ice cube toward a stationary ice cube and observe the path and velocities of the ice cubes after the collision. Try to avoid edge-on collisions and collisions with rotating ice cubes. Explain the speeds and directions of the ice cubes using momentum. Here’s a trick for remembering which collisions are elastic and which are inelastic: Elastic is a bouncy material, so when objects bounce off one another in the collision and separate, it is an elastic collision. When they don’t, the collision is inelastic. Solving Collision Problems The Khan Academy videos referenced in this section show examples of elastic and inelastic collisions in one dimension. In one-dimensional collisions, the incoming and outgoing velocities are all along the same line. But what about collisions, such as those between billiard balls, in which objects scatter to the side? These are two-dimensional collisions, and just as we did with two-dimensional forces, we will solve these problems by first choosing a coordinate system and separating the motion into its x and y components. One complication with two-dimensional collisions is that the objects might rotate before or after their collision. For example, if two ice skaters hook arms as they pass each other, they will spin in circles. We will not consider such rotation until later, and so for now, we arrange things so that no rotation is possible. To avoid rotation, we consider only the scattering of point masses—that is, structureless particles that cannot rotate or spin. We start by assuming that Fnet = 0, so that momentum p is conserved. The simplest collision is one in which one of the particles is initially at rest. The best choice for a coordinate system is one with an axis parallel to the velocity of the incoming particle, as shown in . Because momentum is conserved, the components of momentum along the x- and y-axes, displayed as px and py, will also be conserved. With the chosen coordinate system, py is initially zero and px is the momentum of the incoming particle. A two-dimensional collision with the coordinate system chosen so that m2 is initially at rest and v1 is parallel to the x-axis.Now, we will take the conservation of momentum equation, p1 + p2 = p′1 + p′2 and break it into its x and y components. Along the x-axis, the equation for conservation of momentum is p 1x + p 2x = p ′ 1x + p ′ 2x . In terms of masses and velocities, this equation is m 1 v 1x + m 2 v 2x = m 1 v ′ 1x + m 2 v ′ 2x . But because particle 2 is initially at rest, this equation becomes m 1 v 1x = m 1 v ′ 1x + m 2 v ′ 2x . The components of the velocities along the x-axis have the form v cos θ . Because particle 1 initially moves along the x-axis, we find v1x = v1. Conservation of momentum along the x-axis gives the equation m 1 v 1 = m 1 v ′ 1 cos θ 1 + m 2 v ′ 2 cos θ 2 , where θ 1 and θ 2 are as shown in . Along the y-axis, the equation for conservation of momentum is p 1y + p 2y = p ′ 1y + p ′ 2y , or m 1 v 1y + m 2 v 2y = m 1 v ′ 1y + m 2 v ′ 2y . But v1y is zero, because particle 1 initially moves along the x-axis. Because particle 2 is initially at rest, v2y is also zero. The equation for conservation of momentum along the y-axis becomes 0 = m 1 v ′ 1 y+ m 2 v ′ 2 y . The components of the velocities along the y-axis have the form v sin θ . Therefore, conservation of momentum along the y-axis gives the following equation: 0= m 1 v ′ 1 sin θ 1 + m 2 v ′ 2 sin θ 2 Teacher Support Review conservation of momentum and the equations derived in the previous sections of this chapter. Say that in the problems of this section, all objects are assumed to be point masses. Explain point masses. Collision Lab In this simulation, you will investigate collisions on an air hockey table. Place checkmarks next to the momentum vectors and momenta diagram options. Experiment with changing the masses of the balls and the initial speed of ball 1. How does this affect the momentum of each ball? What about the total momentum? Next, experiment with changing the elasticity of the collision. You will notice that collisions have varying degrees of elasticity, ranging from perfectly elastic to perfectly inelastic. If you wanted to maximize the velocity of ball 2 after impact, how would you change the settings for the masses of the balls, the initial speed of ball 1, and the elasticity setting? Why? HintPlacing a checkmark next to the velocity vectors and removing the momentum vectors will help you visualize the velocity of ball 2, and pressing the More Data button will let you take readings. Maximize the mass of ball 1 and initial speed of ball 1; minimize the mass of ball 2; and set elasticity to 50 percent. Maximize the mass of ball 2 and initial speed of ball 1; minimize the mass of ball 1; and set elasticity to 100 percent. Maximize the mass of ball 1 and initial speed of ball 1; minimize the mass of ball 2; and set elasticity to 100 percent. Maximize the mass of ball 2 and initial speed of ball 1; minimize the mass of ball 1; and set elasticity to 50 percent. Calculating Velocity: Inelastic Collision of a Puck and a Goalie Find the recoil velocity of a 70 kg ice hockey goalie who catches a 0.150-kg hockey puck slapped at him at a velocity of 35 m/s. Assume that the goalie is at rest before catching the puck, and friction between the ice and the puck-goalie system is negligible (see ). An ice hockey goalie catches a hockey puck and recoils backward in an inelastic collision. Strategy Momentum is conserved because the net external force on the puck-goalie system is zero. Therefore, we can use conservation of momentum to find the final velocity of the puck and goalie system. Note that the initial velocity of the goalie is zero and that the final velocity of the puck and goalie are the same. Solution For an inelastic collision, conservation of momentum is m 1 v 1 + m 2 v 2 = ( m 1 + m 2 ) v ′ , where v′ is the velocity of both the goalie and the puck after impact. Because the goalie is initially at rest, we know v2 = 0. This simplifies the equation to m 1 v 1 = ( m 1 + m 2 ) v ′ . Solving for v′ yields v ′ =( m 1 m 1 + m 2 ) v 1 . Entering known values in this equation, we get v ′ = ( 0.150kg 70.0kg+0.150kg )(35m/s) = 7.48× 10 −2 m/s. Discussion This recoil velocity is small and in the same direction as the puck’s original velocity. Calculating Final Velocity: Elastic Collision of Two Carts Two hard, steel carts collide head-on and then ricochet off each other in opposite directions on a frictionless surface (see ). Cart 1 has a mass of 0.350 kg and an initial velocity of 2 m/s. Cart 2 has a mass of 0.500 kg and an initial velocity of −0.500 m/s. After the collision, cart 1 recoils with a velocity of −4 m/s. What is the final velocity of cart 2? Two carts collide with each other in an elastic collision. Strategy Since the track is frictionless, Fnet = 0 and we can use conservation of momentum to find the final velocity of cart 2. Solution As before, the equation for conservation of momentum for a one-dimensional elastic collision in a two-object system is m 1 v 1 + m 2 v 2 = m 1 v ′ 1 + m 2 v ′ 2 . The only unknown in this equation is v′2. Solving for v′2 and substituting known values into the previous equation yields v ′ 2 = m 1 v 1 + m 2 v 2 − m 1 v ′ 1 m 2 = ( 0.350kg )( 2.00m/s )+( 0.500 kg )( −0.500 m/s )−( 0.350kg )( −4.00m/s ) 0.500kg = 3.70m/s. Discussion The final velocity of cart 2 is large and positive, meaning that it is moving to the right after the collision. Calculating Final Velocity in a Two-Dimensional Collision Suppose the following experiment is performed (). An object of mass 0.250 kg (m1) is slid on a frictionless surface into a dark room, where it strikes an initially stationary object of mass 0.400 kg (m2). The 0.250 kg object emerges from the room at an angle of 45º with its incoming direction. The speed of the 0.250 kg object is originally 2 m/s and is 1.50 m/s after the collision. Calculate the magnitude and direction of the velocity (v′2 and θ 2 ) of the 0.400 kg object after the collision. The incoming object of mass m1 is scattered by an initially stationary object. Only the stationary object’s mass m2 is known. By measuring the angle and speed at which the object of mass m1 emerges from the room, it is possible to calculate the magnitude and direction of the initially stationary object’s velocity after the collision. Strategy Momentum is conserved because the surface is frictionless. We chose the coordinate system so that the initial velocity is parallel to the x-axis, and conservation of momentum along the x- and y-axes applies. Everything is known in these equations except v′2 and θ2, which we need to find. We can find two unknowns because we have two independent equations—the equations describing the conservation of momentum in the x and y directions. Solution First, we’ll solve both conservation of momentum equations ( m 1 v 1 = m 1 v ′ 1 cos θ 1 + m 2 v ′ 2 cos θ 2 and 0= m 1 v ′ 1 sin θ 1 + m 2 v ′ 2 sin θ 2 ) for v′2 sin θ 2 . For conservation of momentum along x-axis, let’s substitute sin θ 2 /tan θ 2 for cos θ 2 so that terms may cancel out later on. This comes from rearranging the definition of the trigonometric identity tan θ = sin θ /cos θ . This gives us m 1 v 1 = m 1 v ′ 1 cos θ 1 + m 2 v ′ 2 sin θ 2 tan θ 2 . Solving for v′2 sin θ 2 yields v ′ 2 sin θ 2 = ( m 1 v 1 − m 1 v ′ 1 cos θ 1 )(tan θ 2 ) m 2 . For conservation of momentum along y-axis, solving for v′2 sin θ 2 yields v ′ 2 sin θ 2 = −( m 1 v ′ 1 sin θ 1 ) m 2 . Since both equations equal v′2 sin θ 2 , we can set them equal to one another, yielding ( m 1 v 1 − m 1 v ′ 1 cos θ 1 )(tan θ 2 ) m 2 = −( m 1 v ′ 1 sin θ 1 ) m 2 . Solving this equation for tan θ 2 , we get tan θ 2 = v ′ 1 sin θ 1 v ′ 1 cos θ 1 − v 1 . Entering known values into the previous equation gives tan θ 2 = (1.50)(0.707) (1.50)(0.707)−2.00 =−1.129. Therefore, θ 2 = tan −1 (−1.129)= 312 0 . Since angles are defined as positive in the counterclockwise direction, m2 is scattered to the right. We’ll use the conservation of momentum along the y-axis equation to solve for v′2. v ′ 2 =− m 1 m 2 v ′ 1 sin θ 1 sin θ 2 Entering known values into this equation gives v ′ 2 =− ( 0.250 ) ( 0.400 ) ( 1.50 )( 0.7071 −0.7485 ) . Therefore, v ′ 2 = 0.886 m/s. Discussion Either equation for the x- or y-axis could have been used to solve for v′2, but the equation for the y-axis is easier because it has fewer terms. Practice Problems In an elastic collision, an object with momentum 25 kg ⋅ m/s collides with another that has a momentum 35 kg ⋅ m/s. The first object’s momentum changes to 10 kg ⋅ m/s. What is the final momentum of the second object? 10 kg ⋅ m/s 20 kg ⋅ m/s 35 kg ⋅ m/s 50 kg ⋅ m/s Check Your Understanding What is an elastic collision? An elastic collision is one in which the objects after impact are deformed permanently. An elastic collision is one in which the objects after impact lose some of their internal kinetic energy. An elastic collision is one in which the objects after impact do not lose any of their internal kinetic energy. An elastic collision is one in which the objects after impact become stuck together and move with a common velocity. What is the equation for conservation of momentum for two objects in a one-dimensional collision? p1 + p1′ = p2 + p2′ p1 + p2 = p1′ + p2′ p1 − p2 = p1′ − p2′ p1 + p2 + p1′ + p2′ = 0 Teacher Support Use the Check Your Understanding questions to assess whether students master the learning objectives of this section. If students are struggling with a specific objective, the assessment will help identify which objective is causing the problem and direct students to the relevant content. Section Summary If kinetic energy is conserved, the collision is elastic. If they stick together, the collision is perfectly inelastic. Kinetic energy is conserved in an elastic collision, but not in an inelastic collision. The approach to two-dimensional collisions is to choose a convenient coordinate system and break the motion into components along perpendicular axes. Choose a coordinate system with the x-axis parallel to the velocity of the incoming particle. Two-dimensional collisions of point masses, where mass 2 is initially at rest, conserve momentum along the initial direction of mass 1, or the x-axis, and along the direction perpendicular to the initial direction, or the y-axis. Point masses are structureless particles that cannot spin.

The first object’s momentum changes to 15 kg⋅m/s, and it is now moving to the right. What is the magnitude of the momentum of the second object after the collision?5 kg⋅m/s 10 kg⋅m/s 25 kg⋅m/s 75 kg⋅m/s Performance Task You will need the following: balls of different weights a ruler or wooden strip some books a paper cup Make an inclined plane by resting one end of a ruler on a stack of books. Place a paper cup on the other end. Roll a ball from the top of the ruler so that it hits the paper cup. Measure the displacement of the paper cup due to the collision. Now use increasingly heavier balls for this activity and see how that affects the displacement of the cup. Plot a graph of mass vs. displacement. Now repeat the same activity, but this time, instead of using different balls, change the incline of the ruler by varying the height of the stack of books. This will give you different velocities of the ball. See how this affects the displacement of the paper cup. Test Prep Multiple Choice In which type of collision is kinetic energy conserved?

Section Key Terms energy gravitational potential energy joule kinetic energy mechanical energy potential energy power watt work work–energy theorem Teacher Support In this section, students learn how work determines changes in kinetic energy and that power is the rate at which work is done. [BL][OL] Review understanding of mass, velocity, and acceleration due to gravity. Define the general definitions of the words potential and kinetic. [AL][AL] Remind students of the equation W=P E e =fmg . Point out that acceleration due to gravity is a constant, therefore PEe that results from work done by gravity will also be constant. Compare this to acceleration due to other forces, such as applying muscles to lift a rock, which may not be constant. The Work–Energy TheoremIn physics, the term work has a very specific definition. Work is application of force, f, to move an object over a distance, d, in the direction that the force is applied. Work, W, is described by the equation W=fd. Some things that we typically consider to be work are not work in the scientific sense of the term. Let’s consider a few examples. Think about why each of the following statements is true. Homework is not work. Lifting a rock upwards off the ground is work. Carrying a rock in a straight path across the lawn at a constant speed is not work. The first two examples are fairly simple. Homework is not work because objects are not being moved over a distance. Lifting a rock up off the ground is work because the rock is moving in the direction that force is applied. The last example is less obvious. Recall from the laws of motion that force is not required to move an object at constant velocity. Therefore, while some force may be applied to keep the rock up off the ground, no net force is applied to keep the rock moving forward at constant velocity. Teacher Support [BL][OL] Explain that, when this theorem is applied to an object that is initially at rest and then accelerates, the 1 2 m v 1 2 term equals zero. [OL][AL] Work is measured in joules and W=fd . Force is measured in newtons and distance in meters, so joules are equivalent to newton-meters ( N⋅m ) Work and energy are closely related. When you do work to move an object, you change the object’s energy. You (or an object) also expend energy to do work. In fact, energy can be defined as the ability to do work. Energy can take a variety of different forms, and one form of energy can transform to another. In this chapter we will be concerned with mechanical energy, which comes in two forms: kinetic energy and potential energy. Kinetic energy is also called energy of motion. A moving object has kinetic energy. Potential energy, sometimes called stored energy, comes in several forms. Gravitational potential energy is the stored energy an object has as a result of its position above Earth’s surface (or another object in space). A roller coaster car at the top of a hill has gravitational potential energy. Let’s examine how doing work on an object changes the object’s energy. If we apply force to lift a rock off the ground, we increase the rock’s potential energy, PE. If we drop the rock, the force of gravity increases the rock’s kinetic energy as the rock moves downward until it hits the ground. The force we exert to lift the rock is equal to its weight, w, which is equal to its mass, m, multiplied by acceleration due to gravity, g. f=w=mg The work we do on the rock equals the force we exert multiplied by the distance, d, that we lift the rock. The work we do on the rock also equals the rock’s gain in gravitational potential energy, PEe. W=P E e =mgd Kinetic energy depends on the mass of an object and its velocity, v. KE= 1 2 m v 2 When we drop the rock the force of gravity causes the rock to fall, giving the rock kinetic energy. When work done on an object increases only its kinetic energy, then the net work equals the change in the value of the quantity 1 2 m v 2 . This is a statement of the work–energy theorem, which is expressed mathematically as W=ΔKE = 1 2 m v 2 2 − 1 2 m v 1 2 . The subscripts 2 and 1 indicate the final and initial velocity, respectively. This theorem was proposed and successfully tested by James Joule, shown in . Does the name Joule sound familiar? The joule (J) is the metric unit of measurement for both work and energy. The measurement of work and energy with the same unit reinforces the idea that work and energy are related and can be converted into one another. 1.0 J = 1.0 N∙m, the units of force multiplied by distance. 1.0 N = 1.0 kg∙m/s2, so 1.0 J = 1.0 kg∙m2/s2. Analyzing the units of the term (1/2)mv2 will produce the same units for joules. The joule is named after physicist James Joule (1818–1889). (C. H. Jeens, Wikimedia Commons)Work and Energy This video explains the work energy theorem and discusses how work done on an object increases the object’s KE. True or falseThe energy increase of an object acted on only by a gravitational force is equal to the product of the object's weight and the distance the object falls. True False Teacher Support Repeat the information on kinetic and potential energy discussed earlier in the section. Have the students distinguish between and understand the two ways of increasing the energy of an object (1) applying a horizontal force to increase KE and (2) applying a vertical force to increase PE. Calculations Involving Work and Power In applications that involve work, we are often interested in how fast the work is done. For example, in roller coaster design, the amount of time it takes to lift a roller coaster car to the top of the first hill is an important consideration. Taking a half hour on the ascent will surely irritate riders and decrease ticket sales. Let’s take a look at how to calculate the time it takes to do work. Recall that a rate can be used to describe a quantity, such as work, over a period of time. Power is the rate at which work is done. In this case, rate means per unit of time. Power is calculated by dividing the work done by the time it took to do the work. P= W t Let’s consider an example that can help illustrate the differences among work, force, and power. Suppose the woman in lifting the TV with a pulley gets the TV to the fourth floor in two minutes, and the man carrying the TV up the stairs takes five minutes to arrive at the same place. They have done the same amount of work ( fd ) on the TV, because they have moved the same mass over the same vertical distance, which requires the same amount of upward force. However, the woman using the pulley has generated more power. This is because she did the work in a shorter amount of time, so the denominator of the power formula, t, is smaller. (For simplicity’s sake, we will leave aside for now the fact that the man climbing the stairs has also done work on himself.) No matter how you move a TV to the fourth floor, the amount of work performed and the potential energy gain are the same.Power can be expressed in units of watts (W). This unit can be used to measure power related to any form of energy or work. You have most likely heard the term used in relation to electrical devices, especially light bulbs. Multiplying power by time gives the amount of energy. Electricity is sold in kilowatt-hours because that equals the amount of electrical energy consumed. The watt unit was named after James Watt (1736–1819) (see ). He was a Scottish engineer and inventor who discovered how to coax more power out of steam engines. Is James Watt thinking about watts? (Carl Frederik von Breda, Wikimedia Commons) Teacher Support [BL][OL] Review the concept that work changes the energy of an object or system. Review the units of work, energy, force, and distance. Use the equations for mechanical energy and work to show what is work and what is not. Make it clear why holding something off the ground or carrying something over a level surface is not work in the scientific sense. [OL] Ask the students to use the mechanical energy equations to explain why each of these is or is not work. Ask them to provide more examples until they understand the difference between the scientific term work and a task that is simply difficult but not literally work (in the scientific sense). [BL][OL] Stress that power is a rate and that rate means \"per unit of time.\" In the metric system this unit is usually seconds. End the section by clearing up any misconceptions about the distinctions between force, work, and power.[AL] Explain relationships between the units for force, work, and power. If W=fd and work can be expressed in J, then P= W t = fd t so power can be expressed in units of N⋅m s Also explain that we buy electricity in kilowatt-hours because, when power is multiplied by time, the time units cancel, which leaves work or energy. Watt’s Steam Engine James Watt did not invent the steam engine, but by the time he was finished tinkering with it, it was more useful. The first steam engines were not only inefficient, they only produced a back and forth, or reciprocal, motion. This was natural because pistons move in and out as the pressure in the chamber changes. This limitation was okay for simple tasks like pumping water or mashing potatoes, but did not work so well for moving a train. Watt was able build a steam engine that converted reciprocal motion to circular motion. With that one innovation, the industrial revolution was off and running. The world would never be the same. One of Watt's steam engines is shown in . The video that follows the figure explains the importance of the steam engine in the industrial revolution. A late version of the Watt steam engine. (Nehemiah Hawkins, Wikimedia Commons) Teacher Support Initiate a discussion on the historical significance of suddenly increasing the amount of power available to industries and transportation. Have students consider the fact that the speed of transportation increased roughly tenfold. Changes in how goods were manufactured were just as great. Ask students how they think the resulting changes in lifestyle compare to more recent changes brought about by innovations such as air travel and the Internet. Watt's Role in the Industrial Revolution This video demonstrates how the watts that resulted from Watt's inventions helped make the industrial revolution possible and allowed England to enter a new historical era. Which form of mechanical energy does the steam engine generate? Potential energy Kinetic energy Nuclear energy Solar energy Before proceeding, be sure you understand the distinctions among force, work, energy, and power. Force exerted on an object over a distance does work. Work can increase energy, and energy can do work. Power is the rate at which work is done. Applying the Work–Energy Theorem An ice skater with a mass of 50 kg is gliding across the ice at a speed of 8 m/s when her friend comes up from behind and gives her a push, causing her speed to increase to 12 m/s. How much work did the friend do on the skater? Strategy The work–energy theorem can be applied to the problem. Write the equation for the theorem and simplify it if possible. W=ΔKE = 1 2 m v 2 2 − 1 2 m v 1 2 Simplify to W= 1 2 m( v 2 2 − v 1 2 ) Solution Identify the variables. m = 50 kg, v 2 =12 m s , and v 1 =8 m s Substitute. W= 1 2 50( 12 2 − 8 2 )=2,000 J Discussion Work done on an object or system increases its energy. In this case, the increase is to the skater’s kinetic energy. It follows that the increase in energy must be the difference in KE before and after the push. This problem illustrates a general technique for approaching problems that require you to apply formulas: Identify the unknown and the known variables, express the unknown variables in terms of the known variables, and then enter all the known values. Teacher SupportIdentify the three variables and choose the relevant equation. Distinguish between initial and final velocity and pay attention to the minus sign. Identify the variables. m = 50 kg, v 2 =12 m s , and v 1 =8 m s Substitute. W= 1 2 50( 12 2 − 8 2 )=2,000 J Practice Problems Check Your Understanding When a coconut falls from a tree, work W is done on it as it falls to the beach.

F is the force of gravity, which is equal to the weight of the coconut, d is the distance the nut falls, m is the mass of the earth, v1 is the initial velocity, and v2 is the velocity with which it hits the beach.

Apply the law of conservation of energy Teacher Support The learning objectives in this section will help your students master the following standards: (6) Science concepts. The student knows that changes occur within a physical system and applies the laws of conservation of energy and momentum. The student is expected to: (B) investigate examples of kinetic and potential energy and their transformations; (D) demonstrate and apply the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum in one dimension. In addition, the High School Physics Laboratory Manual addresses content in this section in the lab titled: Work and Energy, as well as the following standards: (6) Science concepts. The student knows that changes occur within a physical system and applies the laws of conservation of energy and momentum. The student is expected to: (B) investigate examples of kinetic and potential energy and their transformations; (D) demonstrate and apply the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum in one dimension. Section Key Terms law of conservation of energy Teacher Support [BL][OL] Begin by distinguishing mechanical energy from other forms of energy. Explain how the general definition of energy as the ability to do work makes perfect sense in terms of either form of mechanical energy. Discuss the law of conservation of energy and dispel any misconceptions related to this law, such is the idea that moving objects just slow down naturally. Identify heat generated by friction as the usual explanation for apparent violations of the law. [AL] Start a discussion about how other useful forms of energy also end up as wasted heat, such as light, sound, and electricity. Try to get students to understand heat and temperature at a molecular level. Explain that energy lost to friction is really transforming kinetic energy at the macroscopic level to kinetic energy at the atomic level. Mechanical Energy and Conservation of EnergyWe saw earlier that mechanical energy can be either potential or kinetic. In this section we will see how energy is transformed from one of these forms to the other. We will also see that, in a closed system, the sum of these forms of energy remains constant. Quite a bit of potential energy is gained by a roller coaster car and its passengers when they are raised to the top of the first hill. Remember that the potential part of the term means that energy has been stored and can be used at another time. You will see that this stored energy can either be used to do work or can be transformed into kinetic energy. For example, when an object that has gravitational potential energy falls, its energy is converted to kinetic energy. Remember that both work and energy are expressed in joules. Refer back to . The amount of work required to raise the TV from point A to point B is equal to the amount of gravitational potential energy the TV gains from its height above the ground. This is generally true for any object raised above the ground. If all the work done on an object is used to raise the object above the ground, the amount work equals the object’s gain in gravitational potential energy. However, note that because of the work done by friction, these energy–work transformations are never perfect. Friction causes the loss of some useful energy. In the discussions to follow, we will use the approximation that transformations are frictionless.Now, let’s look at the roller coaster in . Work was done on the roller coaster to get it to the top of the first rise; at this point, the roller coaster has gravitational potential energy. It is moving slowly, so it also has a small amount of kinetic energy. As the car descends the first slope, its PE is converted to KE. At the low point much of the original PE has been transformed to KE, and speed is at a maximum. As the car moves up the next slope, some of the KE is transformed back into PE and the car slows down. During this roller coaster ride, there are conversions between potential and kinetic energy. Teacher Support [OL][AL] Ask if definitions of energy make sense to the class, and try to bring out any expressions of confusions or misconceptions. Help them make the logical leap that, if energy is the ability to do work, it makes sense that it is expressed by the same unit of measurement. Ask students to name all the forms of energy they can. Ask if this helps them get a feel for the nature of energy. Ask if they have a problem seeing how some forms of energy, such as sunlight, can do work. [BL][OL] You may want to introduce the concept of a reference point as the starting point of motion. Relate this to the origin of a coordinate grid. [BL] Make it clear that energy is a different property with different units than either force or power. [OL] Help students understand that the speed with which the TV is delivered is not part of the calculation of PE. It is assumed that the speed is constant. Any KE due to increases in delivery speed will be lost when motion stops. [BL] Be sure there is a clear understanding of the distinction between kinetic and potential energy and between velocity and acceleration. Explain that the word potential means that the energy is available but it does not mean that it has to be used or will be used. Energy Skate Park Basics This simulation shows how kinetic and potential energy are related, in a scenario similar to the roller coaster. Observe the changes in KE and PE by clicking on the bar graph boxes. Also try the three differently shaped skate parks. Drag the skater to the track to start the animation. Teacher Support This animation shows the transformations between KE and PE and how speed varies in the process. Later we can refer back to the animation to see how friction converts some of the mechanical energy into heat and how total energy is conserved. On an actual roller coaster, there are many ups and downs, and each of these is accompanied by transitions between kinetic and potential energy. Assume that no energy is lost to friction. At any point in the ride, the total mechanical energy is the same, and it is equal to the energy the car had at the top of the first rise. This is a result of the law of conservation of energy, which says that, in a closed system, total energy is conservedthat is, it is constant. Using subscripts 1 and 2 to represent initial and final energy, this law is expressed as K E 1 +P E 1 =K E 2 +P E 2 . Either side equals the total mechanical energy. The phrase in a closed system means we are assuming no energy is lost to the surroundings due to friction and air resistance. If we are making calculations on dense falling objects, this is a good assumption. For the roller coaster, this assumption introduces some inaccuracy to the calculation. Calculations involving Mechanical Energy and Conservation of Energy When calculating work or energy, use units of meters for distance, newtons for force, kilograms for mass, and seconds for time. This will assure that the result is expressed in joules. Teacher Support [BL][OL] Impress upon the students the significant amount of work required to get a roller coaster car to the top of the first, highest point. Compare it to the amount of work it would take to walk to the top of the roller coaster. Ask students why they may feel tired if they had to walk or climb to the top of the roller coaster (they have to use energy to exert the force required to move their bodies upwards against the force of gravity). Check if students can correctly predict that the ratio of the mass of the car to a person’s mass would be the ratio of work done and energy gained (for example, if the car’s mass was 10 times a person’s mass, the amount of work needed to move the car to the top of the hill would be 10 times the work needed to walk up the hill). Conservation of Energy This video discusses conversion of PE to KE and conservation of energy. The scenario is very similar to the roller coaster and the skate park. It is also a good explanation of the energy changes studied in the snap lab. Teacher Support Before showing the video, review all the equations involving kinetic and potential energy and conservation of energy. Also be sure the students have a qualitative understanding of the energy transformation taking place. Refer back to the snap lab and the simulation lab. Applying the Law of Conservation of Energy A 10 kg rock falls from a 20 m cliff. What is the kinetic and potential energy when the rock has fallen 10 m? Strategy Choose the equation. K E 1 +P E 1 =K E 2 +P E 2 KE= 1 2 m v 2 ; PE=mgh 1 2 m v 1 2 +mg h 1 = 1 2 m v 2 2 +mg h 2 List the knowns. m = 10 kg, v1 = 0, g = 9.80 m s 2 , h1 = 20 m, h2 = 10 m Identify the unknowns. KE2 and PE2 Substitute the known values into the equation and solve for the unknown variables. Solution P E 2 =mg h 2 =10( 9.80 )10=980 J K E 2 =P E 2 −( K E 1 +P E 1 )=980−{ [ 0−[ 10( 9.80 )20 ] ] }=980 J Discussion Alternatively, conservation of energy equation could be solved for v2 and KE2 could be calculated. Note that m could also be eliminated. Note that we can solve many problems involving conversion between KE and PE without knowing the mass of the object in question. This is because kinetic and potential energy are both proportional to the mass of the object. In a situation where KE = PE, we know that mgh = (1/2)mv2. Dividing both sides by m and rearranging, we have the relationship 2gh = v2. Teacher Support Kinetic and potential energy are both proportional to the mass of the object. In a situation where KE = PE, we know that mgh = (1/2)mv2. Dividing both sides by m and rearranging, we get the relationship 2gh = v2. Practice Problems A child slides down a playground slide. If the slide is 3 m high and the child weighs 300 N, how much potential energy does the child have at the top of the slide? (Round g to 10 m/ s 2 . ) 0 J 100 J 300 J 900 J A 0.2 kg apple on an apple tree has a potential energy of 10 J. It falls to the ground, converting all of its PE to kinetic energy. What is the velocity of the apple just before it hits the ground? 0 m/s 2 m/s 10 m/s 50 m/s Converting Potential Energy to Kinetic Energy In this activity, you will calculate the potential energy of an object and predict the object’s speed when all that potential energy has been converted to kinetic energy. You will then check your prediction. You will be dropping objects from a height. Be sure to stay a safe distance from the edge. Don’t lean over the railing too far. Make sure that you do not drop objects into an area where people or vehicles pass by. Make sure that dropping objects will not cause damage. You will need the following: Materials for each pair of students: Four marbles (or similar small, dense objects) Stopwatch Materials for class: Metric measuring tape long enough to measure the chosen height A scale Instructions Procedure Work with a partner. Find and record the mass of four small, dense objects per group. Choose a location where the objects can be safely dropped from a height of at least 15 meters. A bridge over water with a safe pedestrian walkway will work well. Measure the distance the object will fall. Calculate the potential energy of the object before you drop it using PE = mgh = (9.80)mh. Predict the kinetic energy and velocity of the object when it lands using PE = KE and so, mgh= m v 2 2 ; v= 2(9.80)h =4.43 h . One partner drops the object while the other measures the time it takes to fall. Take turns being the dropper and the timer until you have made four measurements. Average your drop multiplied by and calculate the velocity of the object when it landed using v = at = gt = (9.80)t. Compare your results to your prediction. Teacher Support Before students begin the lab, find the nearest location where objects can be dropped safely from a height of at least 15 m. As students work through the lab, encourage lab partners to discuss their observations. Encourage them to discuss differences in results between partners. Ask if there is any confusion about the equations they are using and whether they seem valid based on what they have already learned about mechanical energy. Ask them to discuss the effect of air resistance and how density is related to that effect. Check Your Understanding True or falseIf a rock is thrown into the air, the increase in the height would increase the rocks kinetic energy, and then the increase in the velocity as it falls to the ground would increase its potential energy. True False Identify equivalent terms for stored energy and energy of motion. Stored energy is potential energy, and energy of motion is kinetic energy. Energy of motion is potential energy, and stored energy is kinetic energy. Stored energy is the potential as well as the kinetic energy of the system. Energy of motion is the potential as well as the kinetic energy of the system.

Section Summary Mechanical energy may be either kinetic (energy of motion) or potential (stored energy). Doing work on an object or system changes its energy. Total energy in a closed, isolated system is constant. Key Equations conservation of energy K E 1 +P E 1 =K E 2 +P E 2 Concept Items The starting line of a cross country foot race is at the bottom of a hill. Which form(s) of mechanical energy of the runners will change when the starting gun is fired? Kinetic energy only Potential energy only Both kinetic and potential energy Neither kinetic nor potential energy Critical Thinking True or falseA cyclist coasts down one hill and up another hill until she comes to a stop. The point at which the bicycle stops is lower than the point at which it started coasting because part of the original potential energy has been converted to a quantity of heat and this makes the tires of the bicycle warm. True False Problems The potential energy stored in a compressed spring is U= 1 2 k x 2 , where k is the force constant and x is the distance the spring is compressed from the equilibrium position. Four experimental setups described below can be used to determine the force constant of a spring. Which one(s) require measurement of the fewest number of variables to determine k? Assume the acceleration due to gravity is known. An object is propelled vertically by a compressed spring. An object is propelled horizontally on a frictionless surface by a compressed spring. An object is statically suspended from a spring. An object suspended from a spring is set into oscillatory motion. I only III only I and II only III and IV only The correct answer is (d), which features two setups where two quantities must be measured to find the spring constant. The period of an object suspended from a spring is determined by the mass of the object and the spring constant ( T=2π m/k ) , so only the mass and period need to be measured to find the force constant, k. The distance x a spring stretches when an object is suspended from it can be determined by the equation mg=kx , so only the mass and the distance need to be measured to find k. The remaining two arrangements require measurement of three quantities: the mass and a displacement plus either a height or a speed, since (I) is described by the equation mgh= 1 2 k x 2 and (II) is described by the equation 1 2 k x 2 = 1 2 m v 2 . Test Prep Multiple Choice Test Prep Short Answer True or falseThe formula for gravitational potential energy can be used to explain why joules, J, are equivalent to kg × mg2 / s2 . Show your work. True False True or falseA marble rolls down a slope from height h1 and up another slope to height h2, where (h2 < h1). The difference mg(h1  h2) is equal to the heat lost due to the friction. True False Test Prep Extended Response Acceleration due to gravity on the moon is 1.6 m/s2 or about 16% of the value of g on Earth. If an astronaut on the moon threw a moon rock to a height of 7.8 m, what would be its velocity as it struck the moons surface? How would the fact that the moon has no atmosphere affect the velocity of the falling moon rock? Explain your answer. The velocity of the rock as it hits the ground would be 5.0 m/s. Due to the lack of air friction, there would be complete transformation of the potential energy into the kinetic energy as the rock hits the moons surface. The velocity of the rock as it hits the ground would be 5.0 m/s. Due to the lack of air friction, there would be incomplete transformation of the potential energy into the kinetic energy as the rock hits the moons surface. The velocity of the rock as it hits the ground would be 12 m/s. Due to the lack of air friction, there would be complete transformation of the potential energy into the kinetic energy as the rock hits the moons surface. The velocity of the rock as it hits the ground would be 12 m/s.

The student knows that changes occur within a physical system and applies the laws of conservation of energy and momentum. The student is expected to: (C) describe simple and complex machines and solve problems involving simple machines; (D) define input work, output work, mechanical advantage, and efficiency of machines. In addition, the High School Physics Laboratory Manual addresses content in this section in the lab titled: Work and Energy, as well as the following standards: (6) Science concepts. The student knows that changes occur within a physical system and applies the laws of conservation of energy and momentum. The student is expected to: (D) demonstrate and apply the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum in one dimension. Section Key Terms complex machine efficiency output ideal mechanical advantage inclined plane input work lever mechanical advantage output work pulley screw simple machine wedge wheel and axle Teacher Support In this section you will apply what you have learned about work to find the mechanical advantage and efficiency of simple machines. [BL][OL] Ask the students what they know about machines and work. Dispel any misconceptions that machines reduce the amount of work. Be sure students do not equate machines and motors by asking for (and, if necessary, providing) examples of machines that are not motorized. Explain that simple machines are often hand-held, and that they reduce force, not work. [AL] Ask for recall of the formula W = fd. Explain that the product of force and distance is critical to understanding simple machines. Because the amount of work is not changed, the term fd does not change, but force can decrease if distance increases. This is the underlying principle of all simple machines. Simple Machines Simple machines make work easier, but they do not decrease the amount of work you have to do. Why can’t simple machines change the amount of work that you do? Recall that in closed systems the total amount of energy is conserved. A machine cannot increase the amount of energy you put into it. So, why is a simple machine useful? Although it cannot change the amount of work you do, a simple machine can change the amount of force you must apply to an object, and the distance over which you apply the force. In most cases, a simple machine is used to reduce the amount of force you must exert to do work. The down side is that you must exert the force over a greater distance, because the product of force and distance, fd, (which equals work) does not change. Let’s examine how this works in practice. In (a), the worker uses a type of lever to exert a small force over a large distance, while the pry bar pulls up on the nail with a large force over a small distance. (b) shows the how a lever works mathematically. The effort force, applied at Fe, lifts the load (the resistance force) which is pushing down at Fr. The triangular pivot is called the fulcrum; the part of the lever between the fulcrum and Fe is the effort arm, Le; and the part to the left is the resistance arm, Lr. The mechanical advantage is a number that tells us how many times a simple machine multiplies the effort force. The ideal mechanical advantage, IMA, is the mechanical advantage of a perfect machine with no loss of useful work caused by friction between moving parts. The equation for IMA is shown in (b). (a) A pry bar is a type of lever. (b) The ideal mechanical advantage equals the length of the effort arm divided by the length of the resistance arm of a lever. In general, the IMA = the resistance force, Fr, divided by the effort force, Fe. IMA also equals the distance over which the effort is applied, de, divided by the distance the load travels, dr. IMA= F r F e = d e d r Getting back to conservation of energy, for any simple machine, the work put into the machine, Wi, equals the work the machine puts out, Wo. Combining this with the information in the paragraphs above, we can write W i = W o F e d e = F r d r If F e < F r , then d e > d r . The equations show how a simple machine can output the same amount of work while reducing the amount of effort force by increasing the distance over which the effort force is applied. Introduction to Mechanical Advantage This video shows how to calculate the IMA of a lever by three different methods: (1) from effort force and resistance force; (2) from the lengths of the lever arms, and; (3) from the distance over which the force is applied and the distance the load moves. Teacher Support The beginning of this video may cause more confusion than illumination. It shows a derivation using trig functions that is beyond the scope of this chapter. Interested students may want to work their way through it. Most students should skip to the final two or three minutes which explain the basics of calculating IMA of a lever from different ratios. Review W = fd. Some levers exert a large force to a short effort arm. This results in a smaller force acting over a greater distance at the end of the resistance arm. Examples of this type of lever are baseball bats, hammers, and golf clubs. In another type of lever, the fulcrum is at the end of the lever and the load is in the middle, as in the design of a wheelbarrow. Teacher Support [AL]Tell students there are two other classes of levers with different arrangements of load, fulcrum, and effort. Ask them first to try to sketch these. After they have discovered the three kinds, with or without your help, ask if they can think of examples of the types not shown in . The simple machine shown in is called a wheel and axle. It is actually a form of lever. The difference is that the effort arm can rotate in a complete circle around the fulcrum, which is the center of the axle. Force applied to the outside of the wheel causes a greater force to be applied to the rope that is wrapped around the axle. As shown in the figure, the ideal mechanical advantage is calculated by dividing the radius of the wheel by the radius of the axle. Any crank-operated device is an example of a wheel and axle. Force applied to a wheel exerts a force on its axle. Teacher Support [BL][OL] See if the students grasp the idea that a wheel and axle is really a type of lever. Show them that it looks more like a lever if the wheel is replaced by a crank. Give some examples: hand-powered windlass, steering wheel, door knob, and so on. Ask them why steering wheels had a greater diameter before power steering was invented. [AL] Explain that wheels on vehicles are not really simple machines in the same sense as the one in . The axle on a vehicle does not do work on a load. Energy loss to friction is reduced, but nothing is lifted. An inclined plane and a wedge are two forms of the same simple machine. A wedge is simply two inclined planes back to back. shows the simple formulas for calculating the IMAs of these machines. All sloping, paved surfaces for walking or driving are inclined planes. Knives and axe heads are examples of wedges. An inclined plane is shown on the left, and a wedge is shown on the right. Teacher Support [BL][OL] Talk about how inclined planes and wedges are similar and different. Note that, when using an inclined plane the load moves, but when using a wedge the load is stationary and the machine moves. Explain why more energy is usually lost to friction with these machines than with other simple machines. The screw shown in is actually a lever attached to a circular inclined plane. Wood screws (of course) are also examples of screws. The lever part of these screws is a screw driver. In the formula for IMA, the distance between screw threads is called pitch and has the symbol P. The screw shown here is used to lift very heavy objects, like the corner of a car or a house a short distance. Teacher Support [BL][OL] Suggest that a screw is classified as a separate type of simple machine perhaps because it looks so different from what it really is—an inclined plane which sometimes is turned by a lever. Explain that the combined mechanical advantage can be great. Devices like the one shown in are used to lift cars and even houses. Have the students compare this screw to a wood screw and a circular stairway. [AL] Ask students how the forces exerted by a wood screw are different from those exerted by the screw in . Ask for an explanation of the 2 π in the equation for IMA. shows three different pulley systems. Of all simple machines, mechanical advantage is easiest to calculate for pulleys. Simply count the number of ropes supporting the load. That is the IMA. Once again we have to exert force over a longer distance to multiply force. To raise a load 1 meter with a pulley system you have to pull N meters of rope. Pulley systems are often used to raise flags and window blinds and are part of the mechanism of construction cranes. Three pulley systems are shown here. Teacher Support [BL][OL] The calculation for IMA of a pulley seems too easy to be true, but it is. Ask students to try to understand why IMA is simply N. Tell them that watching the video should make this point clear. Pulleys were once seen on sailing ships and farms, where they were used lift heavy loads. The overhang you may have seen on the end of old barn roofs is where a pulley was once attached. This way bales of hay could be lifted into the hay loft without getting wet. Pulleys can still be seen in use, most commonly on large building cranes. Mechanical Advantage of Inclined Planes and Pulleys The first part of this video shows how to calculate the IMA of pulley systems. The last part shows how to calculate the IMA of an inclined plane. Teacher Support Review what was learned about the IMA of inclined planes and pulley systems before watching the video. Remind the students that, for an ideal machine, work in = work out and that W = fd. The video shows how to find the fs and the ds. How could you use a pulley system to lift a light load to great height? Reduce the radius of the pulley. Increase the number of pulleys. Decrease the number of ropes supporting the load. Increase the number of ropes supporting the load. A complex machine is a combination of two or more simple machines. The wire cutters in combine two levers and two wedges. Bicycles include wheel and axles, levers, screws, and pulleys. Cars and other vehicles are combinations of many machines. Wire cutters are a common complex machine. Teacher Support [BL][OL] Be sure students understand that a complex machine is just a combination of simple machines and is still fairly simple. Don’t let them confuse the term with complicated machines such as computers. Note that the IMAs of the individual simple machines in a complex machine usually multiply because the output force of one machine becomes the input force of the other machine. For an additional fun activity, have the students search the Internet for Rube Goldberg machine. Calculating Mechanical Advantage and Efficiency of Simple Machines In general, the IMA = the resistance force, Fr, divided by the effort force, Fe. IMA also equals the distance over which the effort is applied, de, divided by the distance the load travels, dr. IMA= F r F e = d e d r Refer back to the discussions of each simple machine for the specific equations for the IMA for each type of machine. No simple or complex machines have the actual mechanical advantages calculated by the IMA equations. In real life, some of the applied work always ends up as wasted heat due to friction between moving parts. Both the input work (Wi) and output work (Wo) are the result of a force, F, acting over a distance, d. W i = F i d i and W o = F o d o The efficiency output of a machine is simply the output work divided by the input work, and is usually multiplied by 100 so that it is expressed as a percent. % efficiency= W o W i ×100 Look back at the pictures of the simple machines and think about which would have the highest efficiency. Efficiency is related to friction, and friction depends on the smoothness of surfaces and on the area of the surfaces in contact. How would lubrication affect the efficiency of a simple machine? Teacher Support [BL][OL] Review the material on loss of mechanical energy to heat and the law of conservation of energy. Explain how heat lost because of friction assures that Wo will always be less than Wi preventing efficiency from ever reaching 100%. Efficiency of a Lever The input force of 11 N acting on the effort arm of a lever moves 0.4 m, which lifts a 40 N weight resting on the resistance arm a distance of 0.1 m. What is the efficiency of the machine? Strategy State the equation for efficiency of a simple machine, % efficiency= W o W i ×100 , and calculate Wo and Wi. Both work values are the product Fd. Solution W i = F i d i = (11)(0.4) = 4.4 J and W o = F o d o = (40)(0.1) = 4.0 J, then % efficiency= W o W i ×100= 4.0 4.4 ×100=91% Discussion Efficiency in real machines will always be less than 100 percent because of work that is converted to unavailable heat by friction and air resistance. Wo and Wi can always be calculated as a force multiplied by a distance, although these quantities are not always as obvious as they are in the case of a lever. Teacher Support Teaching tip—When calculating efficiency, it is easy enough to understand what force in and force out are: the force you apply is force in and the weight of the object that is being lifted is force out. The input and output distances are easier to see for the lever, inclined plane and wedge. The other three are not as obvious. For a pulley system, the input distance is how far you pull the rope, and the output distance is the distance the load rises. For a wheel and axle, the input distance is the circumference of the wheel, and the output distance is the circumference of the axle. For a screw, the input distance is the circumference of the circle over which the force is applied, and the output distance is the distance between the screw threads. Practice Problems If a pulley system can lift a 200N load with an effort force of 52 N and has an efficiency of almost 100 percent, how many ropes are supporting the load? 1 rope is required because the actual mechanical advantage is 0.26. 1 rope is required because the actual mechanical advantage is 3.80. 4 ropes are required because the actual mechanical advantage is 0.26. 4 ropes are required because the actual mechanical advantage is 3.80. Check Your Understanding True or falseThe efficiency of a simple machine is always less than 100 percent because some small fraction of the input work is always converted to heat energy due to friction. True False The circular handle of a faucet is attached to a rod that opens and closes a valve when the handle is turned. If the rod has a diameter of 1 cm and the IMA of the machine is 6, what is the radius of the handle? 0.08 cm 0.17 cm 3.0 cm 6.0 cm Teacher Support Use the Check Your Understanding questions to assess students’ achievement of the section’s learning objectives. If students are struggling with a specific objective, the Check Your Understanding will help identify which one and direct students to the relevant content. Section Summary The six types of simple machines make work easier by changing the fd term so that force is reduced at the expense of increased distance. The ratio of output force to input force is a machine’s mechanical advantage. Combinations of two or more simple machines are called complex machines. The ratio of output work to input work is a machine’s efficiency.

A ramp A wedge A pulley A screw Critical Thinking Problems A man is using a wedge to split a block of wood by hitting the wedge with a hammer. This drives the wedge into the wood creating a crack in the wood. When he hits the wedge with a force of 400 N it travels 4 cm into the wood. This caused the wedge to exert a force of 1,400 N sideways increasing the width of the crack by 1 cm . What is the efficiency of the wedge? 0.875 percent 0.14 0.751 87.5 percent An electrician grips the handles of a wire cutter, like the one shown, 10 cm from the pivot and places a wire between the jaws 2 cm from the pivot. If the cutter blades are 2 cm wide and 0.3 cm thick, what is the overall IMA of this complex machine? 1.34 1.53 33.3 33.5 Performance Task Conservation of Energy and Energy Transfer; Cause and Effect; and S&EP, Planning and Carrying Out Investigations Plan an investigation to measure the mechanical advantage of simple machines and compare to the IMA of the machine. Also measure the efficiency of each machine studied. Design an investigation to make these measurements for these simple machines: lever, inclined plane, wheel and axle and a pulley system. In addition to these machines, include a spring scale, a tape measure, and a weight with a loop on top that can be attached to the hook on the spring scale. A spring scale is shown in the image. A spring scale measures weight, not mass. LEVER: Beginning with the lever, explain how you would measure input force, output force, effort arm, and resistance arm. Also explain how you would find the distance the load travels and the distance over which the effort force is applied. Explain how you would use this data to determine IMA and efficiency. INCLINED PLANE: Make measurements to determine IMA and efficiency of an inclined plane. Explain how you would use the data to calculate these values. Which property do you already know? Note that there are no effort and resistance arm measurements, but there are height and length measurements. WHEEL AND AXLE: Again, you will need two force measurements and four distance measurements. Explain how you would use these to calculate IMA and efficiency. SCREW: You will need two force measurements, two distance traveled measurements, and two length measurements. You may describe a screw like the one shown in or you could use a screw and screw driver. (Measurements would be easier for the former). Explain how you would use these to calculate IMA and efficiency. PULLEY SYSTEM: Explain how you would determine the IMA and efficiency of the four-pulley system shown in . Why do you only need two distance measurements for this machine?Design a table that compares the efficiency of the five simple machines. Make predictions as to the most and least efficient machines.Test Prep Multiple Choice A large radius divided by a small radius is the expression used to calculate the IMA of what? A screw A pulley A wheel and axle An inclined plane. Which statement correctly describes the simple machines, like the crank in the image, that make up an Archimedes screw and the forces it applies? The crank is a wedge in which the IMA is the length of the tube divided by the radius of the tube. The applied force is the effort force and the weight of the water is the resistance force. The crank is an inclined plane in which the IMA is the length of the tube divided by the radius of the tube. The applied force is the effort force and the weight of the water is the resistance force. The crank is a wheel and axle. The effort force of the crank becomes the resistance force of the screw. The crank is a wheel and axle. The resistance force of the crank becomes the effort force of the screw. Refer to the pulley system on right in the image. Assume this pulley system is an ideal machine. How hard would you have to pull on the rope to lift a 120 N load? How many meters of rope would you have to pull out of the system to lift the load 1 m? 480 N 4 m 480 N 1 4 m 30 N 4 m 30 N 1 4 m Test Prep Short Answer Why would you expect the lever shown in the top image to have a greater efficiency than the inclined plane shown in the bottom image? The resistance arm is shorter in case of the inclined plane. The effort arm is shorter in case of the inclined plane. The area of contact is greater in case of the inclined plane. Why is the wheel on a wheelbarrow not a simple machine in the same sense as the simple machine in the image? The wheel on the wheelbarrow has no fulcrum. The center of the axle is not the fulcrum for the wheels of a wheelbarrow. The wheelbarrow differs in the way in which load is attached to the axle. The wheelbarrow has less resistance force than a wheel and axle design. A worker pulls down on one end of the rope of a pulley system with a force of 75 N to raise a hay bale tied to the other end of the rope. If she pulls the rope down 2.0 m and the bale raises 1.0 m, what else would you have to know to calculate the efficiency of the pulley system? the weight of the worker the weight of the hay bale the radius of the pulley the height of the pulley from ground True or falseA boy pushed a box with a weight of 300 N up a ramp. He said that, because the ramp was 1.0 m high and 3.0 m long, he must have been pushing with force of exactly 100 N. True False Test Prep Extended Response To dig a hole, one holds the handles together and thrusts the blades of a posthole digger, like the one in the image, into the ground. Next, the handles are pulled apart, which squeezes the dirt between them, making it possible to remove the dirt from the hole. This complex machine is composed of two pairs of two different simple machines. Identify and describe the parts that are simple machines and explain how you would find the IMA of each type of simple machine. Each handle and its attached blade is a lever with the fulcrum at the hinge. Each blade is a wedge. The IMA of a lever would be the length of the handle divided by the length of the blade. The IMA of the wedges would be the length of the blade divided by its width. Each handle and its attached to blade is a lever with the fulcrum at the end. Each blade is a wedge. The IMA of a lever would be the length of the handle divided by the length of the blade. The IMA of the wedges would be the length of the blade divided by its width. Each handle and its attached blade is a lever with the fulcrum at the hinge. Each blade is a wedge. The IMA of a lever would be the length of the handle multiplied by the length of the blade. The IMA of the wedges would be the length of the blade multiplied by its width. Each handle and its attached blade is a lever with the fulcrum at the end. Each blade is a wedge. The IMA of a lever would be the length of the handle multiplied by the length of the blade. The IMA of the wedges would be the length of the blade multiplied by its width. A wooden crate is pulled up a ramp that is 1.0 m high and 6.0 m long. The crate is attached to a rope that is wound around an axle with a radius of 0.020 m . The axle is turned by a 0.20 m long handle.

(s58y, Flickr) Teacher Support Start a discussion that taps into the longing of humans to explore worlds beyond our planet. Is this basic human nature? Perhaps it is; humans have now been almost everywhere there is to go on this planet. Ask students why we have not traveled to other star systems yet. Is it just a matter waiting a few years for technological advances, or is there a more daunting problem? If no one knows, tell them it all has to do with achievable speeds, and use this as a lead-in to Einstein’s postulate related to the speed of light. Have you ever dreamed of traveling to other planets in faraway star systems? The trip might seem possible by traveling fast enough, but you will read in this chapter why it is not. In 1905, Albert Einstein developed the theory of special relativity. Einstein developed the theory to help explain inconsistencies between the equations describing electromagnetism and Newtonian mechanics, and to explain why the ether did not exist. This theory explains the limit on an object’s speed among other implications. Relativity is the study of how different observers moving with respect to one another measure the same events. Galileo and Newton developed the first correct version of classical relativity. Einstein developed the modern theory of relativity. Modern relativity is divided into two parts. Special relativity deals with observers moving at constant velocity. General relativity deals with observers moving at constant acceleration. Einstein’s theories of relativity made revolutionary predictions. Most importantly, his predictions have been verified by experiments. In this chapter, you learn how experiments and puzzling contradictions in existing theories led to the development of the theory of special relativity. You will also learn the simple postulates on which the theory was based; a postulate is a statement that is assumed to be true for the purposes of reasoning in a scientific or mathematic argument. Teacher Support Before students begin this chapter, it is useful to review the following concepts: Using significant figures in calculations—Demonstrate how to use the proper number of significant figures when adding and multiplying. Using scientific notation in calculations—Demonstrate how to use the proper scientific notation and operations in scientific notation (e.g., addition/subtraction, multiplication/division). Converting units—Demonstrate how to convert from km/h to m/s. Calculating average—Demonstrate how to average two numbers by dividing their sum by 2. Reviewing the difference between mass and weight. Commonly used terms—Explain that constant means unchanging. Constant speed refers to speed that is not changing. Explain that initial means starting. Initial time is the time at which the action of a problem begins. Explain that an object that is not moving is often described in physics as being at rest. To reinforce this description, and to open the door for a discussion of frame of reference, take an object, place it in front of the class, and ask someone to describe its motion. Students will likely respond that the object is at rest. Explain that this correct, but it is not the only correct answer. Help students to understand that the object is sitting still but also moving at a high rate of speed as the earth rotates, orbits the sun, etc. It all depends on how you define the frame of reference. Initiate a discussion aimed at making relativity theory less intimidating. Dispel the misconception that “Only three people in the world understand Einstein’s theories.” Stories like this come about because Einstein’s second relativity theory, called general relativity, was more difficult to understand. In this chapter, we will only learn about special relativity.", "formulas": [], "subsections": [{"id": "m54277", "content": "Introduction m54277 Introduction a19303c8-a34a-42f0-824c-9d2b789de384 Special relativity explains why travel to other star systems, such as these in the Orion Nebula, is unlikely using our current level of technology.

The student uses a systematic approach to answer scientific laboratory and field investigative questions. The student is expected to: (C) Know that scientific theories are based on natural and physical phenomena and are capable of being tested by multiple independent researchers. Unlike hypotheses, scientific theories are well-established and well-tested explanations, but may be subject to change as new areas of science and new technologies are developed. (3) Scientific processes. The student uses critical thinking, scientific reasoning, and problem solving to make informed decisions within and outside the classroom. The student is expected to: (D) Explain the impacts of the scientific contributions of a variety of historical and contemporary scientists on scientific thought and society. (4) Science concepts. The student knows and applies the laws governing motion in a variety of situations. The student is expected to: (F) Identify and describe motion relative to different frames of reference. Section Key Terms ether frame of reference inertial reference frame general relativity postulate relativity simultaneity special relativity Teacher Support [AL] Discuss the history of the concept of the ether. Explain that it more of a philosophical concept that was important prior to the development of modern science. It arose from the belief that matter was continuous and vacuums were impossible. Ether was sometimes considered to be one of the elements. [BL][OL] Mention that electromagnetic waves are unique among wave-propagated energy forms, in that they can travel across empty space. This was difficult to believe and caused scientists to doggedly hang onto the idea that there must be an ether permeating space. Ask students what they know about Einstein and dispel any misconceptions. Explain what thought experiments and postulates are. Scientific Experiments and Problems Relativity is not new. Way back around the year 1600, Galileo explained that motion is relative. Wherever you happen to be, it seems like you are at a fixed point and that everything moves with respect to you. Everyone else feels the same way. Motion is always measured with respect to a fixed point. This is called establishing a frame of reference. But the choice of the point is arbitrary, and all frames of reference are equally valid. A passenger in a moving car is not moving with respect to the driver, but they are both moving from the point of view of a person on the sidewalk waiting for a bus. They are moving even faster as seen by a person in a car coming toward them. It is all relative. Teacher Support [OL][AL] Focus students’ thinking on the speed of light. Can the students think of anything else that has a maximum allowable value and is also a universal constant? Most constants are just numbers, like the value of pi. Most properties, such as mass and volume, have no fixed upper limit. Why does speed have a limit? A frame of reference is not a complicated concept. It is just something you decide is a fixed point or group of connected points. It is completely up to you. For example, when you look up at celestial objects in the sky, you choose the earth as your frame of reference, and the sun, moon, etc., seem to move across the sky. Light is involved in the discussion of relativity because theories related to electromagnetism are inconsistent with Galileo’s and Newton’s explanation of relativity. The true nature of light was a hot topic of discussion and controversy in the late 19th century. At the time, it was not generally believed that light could travel across empty space. It was known to travel as waves, and all other types of energy that propagated as waves needed to travel though a material medium. It was believed that space was filled with an invisible medium that light waves traveled through. This imaginary (as it turned out) material was called the ether (also spelled aether). It was thought that everything moved through this mysterious fluid. In other words, ether was the one fixed frame of reference. The Michelson–Morley experiment proved it was not. In 1887, Albert Michelson and Edward Morley designed the interferometer shown in to measure the speed of Earth through the ether. A light beam is split into two perpendicular paths and then recombined. Recombining the waves produces an inference pattern, with a bright fringe at the locations where the two waves arrive in phase; that is, with the crests of both waves arriving together and the troughs arriving together. A dark fringe appears where the crest of one wave coincides with a trough of the other, so that the two cancel. If Earth is traveling through the ether as it orbits the sun, the peaks in one arm would take longer than in the other to reach the same location. The places where the two waves arrive in phase would change, and the interference pattern would shift. But, using the interferometer, there was no shift seen! This result led to two conclusions: that there is no ether and that the speed of light is the same regardless of the relative motion of source and observer. The Michelson–Morley investigation has been called the most famous failed experiment in history. This is a diagram of the instrument used in the MichelsonMorley experiment. Teacher Support [BL][OL] Explain the geometry of the Michelson–Morley experiment. Explain why failure in this case was actually a success. Discuss how accepting unexpected results is an important ability for scientists. Ask students to memorize the value of the speed of light in m/s to three significant figures. To see what Michelson and Morley expected to find when they measured the speed of light in two directions, watch this animation. In the video, two people swimming in a lake are represented as an analogy to light beams leaving Earth as it moves through the ether (if there were any ether). The swimmers swim away from and back to a platform that is moving through the water. The swimmers swim in different directions with respect to the motion of the platform. Even though they swim equal distances at the same speed, the motion of the platform causes them to arrive at different times. Teacher Support [AL]Be sure students understand that this animation does not explain how light behaves. It shows what Michelson and Morley expected to observe. It may work best to just introduce the Michelson—Morley experiment briefly and then watch the animation. Einstein’s Postulates The results described above left physicists with some puzzling and unsettling questions such as, why doesn’t light emitted by a fast-moving object travel faster than light from a street lamp? A radical new theory was needed, and Albert Einstein, shown in , was about to become everyone’s favorite genius. Einstein began with two simple postulates based on the two things we have discussed so far in this chapter. The laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames. The speed of light is the same in all inertial reference frames and is not affected by the speed of its source. Albert Einstein (1879–1955) developed modern relativity and also made fundamental contributions to the foundations of quantum mechanics. (The Library of Congress)The speed of light is given the symbol c and is equal to exactly 299,792,458 m/s. This is the speed of light in vacuum; that is, in the absence of air. For most purposes, we round this number off to 3.00× 10 8 m/s The term inertial reference frame simply refers to a frame of reference where all objects follow Newton’s first law of motion: Objects at rest remain at rest, and objects in motion remain in motion at a constant velocity in a straight line, unless acted upon by an external force. The inside of a car moving along a road at constant velocity and the inside of a stationary house are inertial reference frames. Teacher Support [BL] Ask students to round off the value given for c to 3 significant figures and express in scientific notation. Stress the units of measurements. [OL] Explain the postulates carefully. Note that, although they both seem true, they lead to problems with the classical mechanics of Newton. Explain the concept of reference frame and ask students to think of examples of reference frames that are moving relative to one other. Use vehicles and celestial bodies. Explain that the understanding of relative motion goes back hundreds of years and did not begin with relativity theory. [AL] Explain that it is the combination of these two postulates that leads to unusual results that will follow in the next section and that it is the combination of these postulates that forces us to abandon some aspects of Newtonian physics in some scenarios. Note that the very precise value for the speed of light only applies to light traveling through a vacuum and that in all transparent material media it is slower. The Speed of Light This lecture on light summarizes the most important facts about the speed of light. If you are interested, you can watch the whole video, but the parts relevant to this chapter are found between 3:25 and 5:10, which you find by running your cursor along the bottom of the video. Teacher Support Only the section from 3:25 to 5:10 minutes is completely relevant to an understanding of the speed of light. If students watch it just after the text above, they will be adequately prepared. An airliner traveling at 200 m/s emits light from the front of the plane. Which statement describes the speed of the light? It travels at a speed of c + 200 m/s. It travels at a speed of c  200 m/s. It travels at a speed c, like all light. It travels at a speed slightly less than c. Measure the Speed of Light In this experiment, you will measure the speed of light using a microwave oven and a slice of bread. The waves generated by a microwave oven are not part of the visible spectrum, but they are still electromagnetic radiation, so they travel at the speed of light. If we know the wavelength, λ, and frequency, f, of a wave, we can calculate its speed, v, using the equation v = λf. You can measure the wavelength. You will find the frequency on a label on the back of a microwave oven. The wave in a microwave is a standing wave with areas of high and low intensity. The high intensity sections are one-half wavelength apart. High temperature: Very hot temperatures are encountered in this lab. These can cause burns. a microwave oven one slice of plain white bread a centimeter ruler a calculator Work with a partner. Turn off the revolving feature of the microwave oven or remove the wheels under the microwave dish that make it turn. It is important that the dish does not turn. Place the slice of bread on the dish, set the microwave on high, close the door, run the microwave for about 15 seconds. A row of brown or black marks should appear on the bread. Stop the microwave as soon as they appear. Measure the distance between two adjacent burn marks and multiply the result by 2. This is the wavelength. The frequency of the waves is written on the back of the microwave. Look for something like “2,450 MHz.” Hz is the unit hertz, which means per second. The M represents mega, which stands for million, so multiply the number by 106. Express the wavelength in meters and multiply it times the frequency. If you did everything correctly, you will get a number very close to the speed of light. Do not eat the bread. It is a general laboratory safety rule never to eat anything in the lab. Teacher Support This experiment could be demonstrated to the class if a microwave is available in the classroom. It might be better to let the students do the experiment at home so they can get more of a hands-on experience. Before the lab you might have them watch this video. To continue the discussion, you could tell them about how light is refracted when it changes speed as it passes from one medium to another. Because light speed in air is slower than in a vacuum, light is refracted as it enters Earth’s atmosphere. This link takes you to a video demonstrating how to measure the speed of light using a microwave, a ruler, and a bar of chocolate. There is also an accompanying article with background information on measuring the speed of light. How does your measured value of the speed of light compare to the accepted value (% error)? The measured value of speed will be equal to c. The measured value of speed will be slightly less than c. The measured value of speed will be slightly greater than c. The measured value of speed will depend on the frequency of the microwave. Teacher Support [AL] This will be difficult to grasp completely for some students. The fact that the observers see different things is the result of the two postulates being true. If light speed is a constant and the two frames of reference are both valid, then simultaneity is not the same for all observers. Ask them to try the thought experiment in their own head to grasp what is being shown here. Sometimes students have fun sketching a cartoon that explains or demonstrates difficult concepts. They can then show the cartoon to the class and explain their reasoning. [OL] If students are struggling with this explanation of simultaneity, let them know that there will be an animation in the next section that should make it clearer. [OL][BL] Point out that the relationship between special relativity and Newton’s mechanics is an excellent example of how science advances. Explain that new theories rarely reverse old theories. It is more common that new theories extend and expand on old theories. Ask students if they can think of other examples from the history of science. Einstein’s postulates were carefully chosen, and they both seemed very likely to be true. Einstein proceeded despite realizing that these two ideas taken together and applied to extreme conditions led to results that contradict Newtonian mechanics. He just took the ball and ran with it. In the traditional view, velocities are additive. If you are running at 3 m/s and you throw a ball forward at a speed of 10 m/s, the ball should have a net speed of 13 m/s. However, according to relativity theory, the speed of a moving light source is not added to the speed of the emitted light. In addition, Einstein’s theory shows that if you were moving forward relative to Earth at nearly c (the speed of light) and could throw a ball forward at c, an observer at rest on the earth would not see the ball moving at nearly twice the speed of light. The observer would see it moving at a speed that is still less than c. This result conforms to both of Einstein’s postulates: The speed of light has a fixed maximum and neither reference frame is privileged. Consider how we measure elapsed time. If we use a stopwatch, for example, how do we know when to start and stop the watch? One method is to use the arrival of light from the event, such as observing a light turn green to start a drag race. The timing will be more accurate if some sort of electronic detection is used, avoiding human reaction times and other complications. Now suppose we use this method to measure the time interval between two flashes of light produced by flash lamps on a moving train. (See ) Light arriving to observer A as seen by two different observers. A woman (observer A) is seated in the center of a rail car, with two flash lamps at opposite sides equidistant from her. Multiple light rays that are emitted from the flash lamps move towards observer A, as shown with arrows. A velocity vector arrow for the rail car is shown towards the right. A man (observer B) standing on the platform is facing the woman and also observes the flashes of light. Observer A moves with the lamps on the rail car as the rail car moves towards the right of observer B. Observer B receives the light flashes simultaneously, and sees the bulbs as both having flashed at the same time. However, he sees observer A receive the flash from the right first. Because the pulse from the right reaches her first, in her frame of reference she sees the bulbs as not having flashed simultaneously. Here, a relative velocity between observers affects whether two events at well-separated locations are observed to be simultaneous. Simultaneity, or whether different events occur at the same instant, depends on the frame of reference of the observer. Remember that velocity equals distance divided by time, so t = d/v. If velocity appears to be different, then duration of time appears to be different. This illustrates the power of clear thinking. We might have guessed incorrectly that, if light is emitted simultaneously, then two observers halfway between the sources would see the flashes simultaneously. But careful analysis shows this not to be the case. Einstein was brilliant at this type of thought experiment (in German, Gedankenexperiment). He very carefully considered how an observation is made and disregarded what might seem obvious. The validity of thought experiments, of course, is determined by actual observation. The genius of Einstein is evidenced by the fact that experiments have repeatedly confirmed his theory of relativity. No experiments after that of Michelson and Morley were able to detect any ether medium. We will describe later how experiments also confirmed other predictions of special relativity, such as the distance between two objects and the time interval of two events being different for two observers moving with respect to each other. In summary: Two events are defined to be simultaneous if an observer measures them as occurring at the same time (such as by receiving light from the events). Two events are not necessarily simultaneous to all observers. The discrepancies between Newtonian mechanics and relativity theory illustrate an important point about how science advances. Einstein’s theory did not replace Newton’s but rather extended it. It is not unusual that a new theory must be developed to account for new information. In most cases, the new theory is built on the foundation of older theory. It is rare that old theories are completely replaced. In this chapter, you will learn about the theory of special relativity, but, as mentioned in the introduction, Einstein developed two relativity theories: special and general. summarizes the differences between the two theories. Comparing Special Relativity and General Relativity Special Relativity General Relativity Published in 1905 Final form published in 1916 A theory of space-time A theory of gravity Applies to observers moving at constant speed Applies to observers that are accelerating Most useful in the field of nuclear physics Most useful in the field of astrophysics Accepted quickly and put to practical use by nuclear physicists and quantum chemists Largely ignored until 1960 when new mathematical techniques made the theory more accessible and astronomers found some important applications Also note that the theory of general relativity includes the theory of special relativity. Calculating the Time it Takes Light to Travel a Given Distance The sun is 1.50 × 108 km from Earth. How long does it take light to travel from the sun to Earth in minutes and seconds? Strategy Identify knowns. Distance = 1.50 × 10 8 km Speed = 3.00 × 10 8 km Identify unknowns. Time Find the equation that relates knowns and unknowns. v= d t ; t= d v Be sure to use consistent units. Solution t= d v = (1.50 × 10 8 km) × 10 3 m km 3.00 × 10 8 m s =5.00× 10 2 s 500 s = 8 min and 20 s Discussion The answer is written as 5.00 × 102 rather than 500 in order to show that there are three significant figures. When astronomers witness an event on the sun, such as a sunspot, it actually happened minutes earlier. Compare 8 light minutes to the distance to stars, which are light years away. Any events on other stars happened years ago. Teacher Support Identify the three variables and choose the relevant equation. In physics, calculations are usually done using units of meters and seconds. Use scientific notation to keep track of significant figures. Practice Problems Light travels through 1.00 m of water in 4.42×10-9 s.

The signal is sent by a form of electromagnetic radiation and takes 1.28 s to travel the distance between Earth and the moon. What is the distance from Earth to the moon? 2.34×105 km 2.34×108 km 3.84×105 km 3.84×108 km Check Your Understanding Teacher Support Use the Check Your Understanding questions to assess students’ achievement of the section’s learning objectives. If students are struggling with a specific objective, the Check Your Understanding will help identify which and direct students to the relevant content. Two people swim away from a raft that is floating downstream. One swims upstream and returns, and the other swims across the current and back. If this scenario represents the MichelsonMorley experiment, what do (i) the water, (ii) the swimmers, and (iii) the raft represent? the ether rays of light Earth rays of light the ether Earth the ether Earth rays of light Earth rays of light the ether If Michelson and Morley had observed the interference pattern shift in their interferometer, what would that have indicated? The speed of light is the same in all frames of reference. The speed of light depends on the motion relative to the ether. The speed of light changes upon reflection from a surface. The speed of light in vacuum is less than 3.00×108 m/s. If you designate a point as being fixed and use that point to measure the motion of surrounding objects, what is the point called? An origin A frame of reference A moving frame A coordinate system Section Summary One postulate of special relativity theory is that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference. The other postulate is that the speed of light in a vacuum is the same in all inertial frames. Einstein showed that simultaneity, or lack of it, depends on the frame of reference of the observer. Key Equations speed of light v=λf constant value for the speed of light c= 3.00 × 10 8 m/s Concept Items Describe the relative motion of Earth and the sun: if Earth is taken as the inertial frame of reference and if the sun is taken as the inertial frame of reference. Earth is at rest and the sun orbits Earth. The sun is at rest and Earth orbits the sun. The sun is at rest and Earth orbits the sun. Earth is at rest and the sun orbits Earth. The sun is at rest and Earth orbits the sun. The sun is at rest and Earth orbits the sun. Earth is at rest and the sun orbits Earth. Earth is at rest and the sun orbits Earth. Critical Thinking Explain how the two postulates of Einsteins theory of special relativity, when taken together, could lead to a situation that seems to contradict the mechanics and laws of motion as described by Newton. In Newtonian mechanics, velocities are multiplicative but the speed of a moving light source cannot be multiplied to the speed of light because, according to special relativity, the speed of light is the maximum speed possible. In Newtonian mechanics, velocities are additive but the speed of a moving light source cannot be added to the speed of light because the speed of light is the maximum speed possible. An object that is at rest in one frame of reference may appear to be in motion in another frame of reference, while in Newtonian mechanics such a situation is not possible. The postulates of Einsteins theory of special relativity do not contradict any situation that Newtonian mechanics explains. In 2003, Earth and Mars were the closest they had been in 50,000 years. The two planets were aligned so that Earth was between Mars and the sun. At that time it took light from the sun 500 s to reach Earth and 687 s to get to Mars. What was the distance from Mars to Earth? 5.6×107 km 5.6×1010 km 6.2×106 km 6.2×1012 km Use the postulates of the special relativity theory to explain why the speed of light emitted from a fast-moving light source cannot exceed 3.00×108 m/s. The speed of light is maximum in the frame of reference of the moving object. The speed of light is minimum in the frame of reference of the moving object. The speed of light is the same in all frames of reference, including in the rest frame of its source. Light always travels in a vacuum with a speed less than 3.00×108 m/s, regardless of the speed of the source. Test Prep Multiple Choice What was the purpose of the MichelsonMorley experiment? To determine the exact speed of light To analyze the electromagnetic spectrum To establish that Earth is the true frame of reference To learn how the ether affected the propagation of light In 2003, Earth and Mars were aligned so that Earth was between Mars and the sun. Earth and Mars were 5.6×107 km from each other, which was the closest they had been in 50,000 years. People looking up saw Mars as a very bright red light on the horizon. If Mars was 2.06×108 km from the sun, how long did the reflected light people saw take to travel from the sun to Earth? 14 min and 33 s 12 min and 15 s 11 min and 27 s 3 min and 7 s Test Prep Short Answer What is the postulate having to do with the speed of light on which the theory of special relativity is based? The speed of light remains the same in all inertial frames of reference. The speed of light depends on the speed of the source emitting the light. The speed of light changes with change in medium through which it travels. The speed of light does not change with change in medium through which it travels. What is the postulate having to do with reference frames on which the theory of special relativity is based? The frame of reference chosen is arbitrary as long as it is inertial. The frame of reference is chosen to have constant nonzero acceleration. The frame of reference is chosen in such a way that the object under observation is at rest. The frame of reference is chosen in such a way that the object under observation is moving with a constant speed. If you look out the window of a moving car at houses going past, you sense that you are moving. What have you chosen as your frame of reference? the car the sun a house Why did Michelson and Morley orient light beams at right angles to each other? To observe the particle nature of light To observe the effect of the passing ether on the speed of light To obtain a diffraction pattern by combination of light To obtain a constant path difference for interference of light Test Prep Extended Response Explain how Einstein’s conclusion that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light contradicts an older concept about the speed of an object propelled from another, already moving, object. The older concept is that speeds are subtractive. For example, if a person throws a ball while running, the speed of the ball relative to the ground is the speed at which the person was running minus the speed of the throw. A relativistic example is when light is emitted from car headlights, it moves faster than the speed of light emitted from a stationary source. The older concept is that speeds are additive. For example, if a person throws a ball while running, the speed of the ball relative to the ground is the speed at which the person was running plus the speed of the throw. A relativistic example is when light is emitted from car headlights, it moves no faster than the speed of light emitted from a stationary source. The car's speed does not affect the speed of light. The older concept is that speeds are multiplicative. For example, if a person throws a ball while running, the speed of the ball relative to the ground is the speed at which the person was running multiplied by the speed of the throw. A relativistic example is when light is emitted from car headlights, it moves no faster than the speed of light emitted from a stationary source. The car's speed does not affect the speed of light. The older concept is that speeds are frame independent. For example, if a person throws a ball while running, the speed of the ball relative to the ground has nothing to do with the speed at which the person was running. A relativistic example is when light is emitted from car headlights, it moves no faster than the speed of light emitted from a stationary source. The car's speed does not affect the speed of light. A rowboat is drifting downstream. One person swims 20 m toward the shore and back, and another, leaving at the same time, swims upstream 20 m and back to the boat. The swimmer who swam toward the shore gets back first. Explain how this outcome is similar to the outcome expected in the MichelsonMorley experiment. The rowboat represents Earth, the swimmers are beams of light, and the water is acting as the ether. Light going against the current of the ether would get back later because, by then, Earth would have moved on. The rowboat represents the beam of light, the swimmers are the ether, and water is acting as Earth. Light going against the current of the ether would get back later because, by then, Earth would have moved on. The rowboat represents the ether, the swimmers are ray of light, and the water is acting as the earth. Light going against the current of the ether would get back later because, by then, Earth would have moved on.

The student knows and applies the laws governing motion in a variety of situations. The student is expected to: (F) Identify and describe motion relative to different frames of reference. (8) Science concepts. The student knows simple examples of atomic, nuclear, and quantum phenomena. The student is expected to: (C) Describe the significance of mass-energy equivalence and apply it in explanations of phenomena such as nuclear stability, fission, and fusion. Section Key Terms binding energy length contraction mass defect time dilation proper length relativistic relativistic momentum relativistic energy relativistic factor rest mass Teacher Support In this section, you will see how the postulates lead to the theory of special relativity and see how that theory predicts effects on time, distance, momentum, and energy at velocities approaching the speed of light. [BL] Begin a discussion by asking if students have ever seen a science fiction movie where space travelers age more slowly than the people left behind on Earth. Tell them there is some basis in fact to these stories. Discuss nuclear power. Ask if they know the basic difference between the nuclear power and combustion power. [OL] Explain that Newton’s laws are valid for everyday mechanics but break down at speeds approaching the speed of light. Discuss the relationship between relativity theory and Newton’s laws. Briefly describe the changes predicted for measurements of time, length, momentum, and energy. See how much they know about energy derived from nuclear reactions. [AL] Ask what the students already know about relativity theory. See if they know that relative motion is an old idea and ask for examples of relative motion in everyday situations. Explain that special relativity is similar but describes unexpected results at speeds approaching the speed of light. Ask if anyone can explain why this statement is true: “The original source of all the energy we use is the conversion of matter into energy.” Relativistic Effects on Time, Distance, and MomentumConsideration of the measurement of elapsed time and simultaneity leads to an important relativistic effect. Time dilation is the phenomenon of time passing more slowly for an observer who is moving relative to another observer. For example, suppose an astronaut measures the time it takes for light to travel from the light source, cross her ship, bounce off a mirror, and return. (See .) How does the elapsed time the astronaut measures compare with the elapsed time measured for the same event by a person on the earth? Asking this question (another thought experiment) produces a profound result. We find that the elapsed time for a process depends on who is measuring it. In this case, the time measured by the astronaut is smaller than the time measured by the earth bound observer. The passage of time is different for the two observers because the distance the light travels in the astronaut’s frame is smaller than in the earth bound frame. Light travels at the same speed in each frame, and so it will take longer to travel the greater distance in the earth bound frame. Teacher Support [OL] Discuss the expression for the relativistic factor. Explain that this is involved in all relativistic effects. Show how to tell when relativistic effects are significant and when they are negligible by plugging in values of v and c. (a) An astronaut measures the time Δ t 0 for light to cross her ship using an electronic timer. Light travels a distance 2D in the astronaut’s frame. (b) A person on the earth sees the light follow the longer path 2s and take a longer time Δt . Teacher Support [AL], like , may be hard for some students to grasp. Refer back to the previous figure. The animation in the discussion of length contraction further on should also be some help. The relationship between Δt and Δto is given by Δt=γΔ t 0 , where γ is the relativistic factor given by γ= 1 1− v 2 c 2 , and v and c are the speeds of the moving observer and light, respectively. Try putting some values for v into the expression for the relativistic factor ( γ ). Observe at which speeds this factor will make a difference and when γ is so close to 1 that it can be ignored. Try 225 m/s, the speed of an airliner; 2.98 × 104 m/s, the speed of Earth in its orbit; and 2.990 × 108 m/s, the speed of a particle in an accelerator. Teacher Support Try putting some values for v into the expression for the relativistic factor. Observe at which speeds this factor will make a difference and when it is so close to 1 that it can be ignored. Notice that when the velocity v is small compared to the speed of light c, then v/c becomes small, and γ becomes close to 1. When this happens, time measurements are the same in both frames of reference. Relativistic effects, meaning those that have to do with special relativity, usually become significant when speeds become comparable to the speed of light. This is seen to be the case for time dilation. You may have seen science fiction movies in which space travelers return to Earth after a long trip to find that the planet and everyone on it has aged much more than they have. This type of scenario is a based on a thought experiment, known as the twin paradox, which imagines a pair of twins, one of whom goes on a trip into space while the other stays home. When the space traveler returns, she finds her twin has aged much more than she. This happens because the traveling twin has been in two frames of reference, one leaving Earth and one returning. Time dilation has been confirmed by comparing the time recorded by an atomic clock sent into orbit to the time recorded by a clock that remained on Earth. GPS satellites must also be adjusted to compensate for time dilation in order to give accurate positioning. Have you ever driven on a road, like that shown in , that seems like it goes on forever? If you look ahead, you might say you have about 10 km left to go. Another traveler might say the road ahead looks like it is about 15 km long. If you both measured the road, however, you would agree. Traveling at everyday speeds, the distance you both measure would be the same. You will read in this section, however, that this is not true at relativistic speeds. Close to the speed of light, distances measured are not the same when measured by different observers moving with respect to one other. People might describe distances differently, but at relativistic speeds, the distances really are different. (Corey Leopold, Flickr) Teacher Support [OL] Discuss the relationship between time dilation and length contraction. If observers agree on speed, but not on time, they must also disagree on length because v = d/t. One thing all observers agree upon is their relative speed. When one observer is traveling away from another, they both see the other receding at the same speed, regardless of whose frame of reference is chosen. Remember that speed equals distance divided by time: v = d/t. If the observers experience a difference in elapsed time, they must also observe a difference in distance traversed. This is because the ratio d/t must be the same for both observers. The shortening of distance experienced by an observer moving with respect to the points whose distance apart is measured is called length contraction. Proper length, L0, is the distance between two points measured in the reference frame where the observer and the points are at rest. The observer in motion with respect to the points measures L. These two lengths are related by the equation L= L 0 γ . Because γ is the same expression used in the time dilation equation above, the equation becomes L= L 0 1− v 2 c 2 . To see how length contraction is seen by a moving observer, go to this simulation. Here you can also see that simultaneity, time dilation, and length contraction are interrelated phenomena. This link is to a simulation that illustrates the relativity of simultaneous events. In classical physics, momentum is a simple product of mass and velocity. When special relativity is taken into account, objects that have mass have a speed limit. What effect do you think mass and velocity have on the momentum of objects moving at relativistic speeds; i.e., speeds close to the speed of light? Momentum is one of the most important concepts in physics. The broadest form of Newton’s second law is stated in terms of momentum. Momentum is conserved in classical mechanics whenever the net external force on a system is zero. This makes momentum conservation a fundamental tool for analyzing collisions. We will see that momentum has the same importance in modern physics. Relativistic momentum is conserved, and much of what we know about subatomic structure comes from the analysis of collisions of accelerator-produced relativistic particles. One of the postulates of special relativity states that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames. Does the law of conservation of momentum survive this requirement at high velocities? The answer is yes, provided that the momentum is defined as follows. Relativistic momentum, p, is classical momentum multiplied by the relativistic factor γ . p=γmu, where m is the rest mass of the object (that is, the mass measured at rest, without any γ factor involved), u is its velocity relative to an observer, and γ, as before, is the relativistic factor. We use the mass of the object as measured at rest because we cannot determine its mass while it is moving.Note that we use u for velocity here to distinguish it from relative velocity v between observers. Only one observer is being considered here. With p defined in this way, p tot is conserved whenever the net external force is zero, just as in classical physics. Again we see that the relativistic quantity becomes virtually the same as the classical at low velocities. That is, relativistic momentum γmu becomes the classical mu at low velocities, because γ is very nearly equal to 1 at low velocities.Relativistic momentum has the same intuitive feel as classical momentum. It is greatest for large masses moving at high velocities. Because of the factor γ, however, relativistic momentum behaves differently from classical momentum by approaching infinity as u approaches c . (See .) This is another indication that an object with mass cannot reach the speed of light. If it did, its momentum would become infinite, which is an unreasonable value. Relativistic momentum approaches infinity as the velocity of an object approaches the speed of light. Teacher Support [OL] Discuss the graph. Explain how it shows that objects that have mass cannot reach the speed of light. Have the students analyze the equation for relativistic momentum and see how this supports this conclusion. Explain that light can travel at the speed of light because it has no rest mass. Relativistic momentum is defined in such a way that the conservation of momentum will hold in all inertial frames. Whenever the net external force on a system is zero, relativistic momentum is conserved, just as is the case for classical momentum. This has been verified in numerous experiments. Mass-Energy Equivalence Let us summarize the calculation of relativistic effects on objects moving at speeds near the speed of light. In each case we will need to calculate the relativistic factor, given by γ= 1 1− v 2 c 2 , where v and c are as defined earlier. We use u as the velocity of a particle or an object in one frame of reference, and v for the velocity of one frame of reference with respect to another.Time DilationElapsed time on a moving object, Δ t 0 , as seen by a stationary observer is given by Δt=γΔ t 0 , where Δ t 0 is the time observed on the moving object when it is taken to be the frame or reference. Length Contraction Length measured by a person at rest with respect to a moving object, L, is given by L= L 0 γ , where L0 is the length measured on the moving object. Relativistic Momentum Momentum, p, of an object of mass, m, traveling at relativistic speeds is given by p=γmu , where u is velocity of a moving object as seen by a stationary observer. Relativistic Energy The original source of all the energy we use is the conversion of mass into energy. Most of this energy is generated by nuclear reactions in the sun and radiated to Earth in the form of electromagnetic radiation, where it is then transformed into all the forms with which we are familiar. The remaining energy from nuclear reactions is produced in nuclear power plants and in Earth’s interior. In each of these cases, the source of the energy is the conversion of a small amount of mass into a large amount of energy. These sources are shown in . The sun (a) and the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station (b) both convert mass into energy. ((a) NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center, Scientific Visualization Studio; (b) U.S. government)The first postulate of relativity states that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames. Einstein showed that the law of conservation of energy is valid relativistically, if we define energy to include a relativistic factor. The result of his analysis is that a particle or object of mass m moving at velocity u has relativistic energy given by E=γm c 2 . This is the expression for the total energy of an object of mass m at any speed u and includes both kinetic and potential energy. Look back at the equation for γ and you will see that it is equal to 1 when u is 0; that is, when an object is at rest. Then the rest energy, E0, is simply E 0 =m c 2 . This is the correct form of Einstein’s famous equation. This equation is very useful to nuclear physicists because it can be used to calculate the energy released by a nuclear reaction. This is done simply by subtracting the mass of the products of such a reaction from the mass of the reactants. The difference is the m in E 0 =m c 2 . Here is a simple example: A positron is a type of antimatter that is just like an electron, except that it has a positive charge. When a positron and an electron collide, their masses are completely annihilated and converted to energy in the form of gamma rays. Because both particles have a rest mass of 9.11 × 10–31 kg, we multiply the mc2 term by 2. So the energy of the gamma rays is E 0 = 2(9.11× 10 −31 kg) (3.00× 10 8 m s ) 2 = 1.64× 10 −13 kg⋅ m 2 s 2 = 1.64× 10 −13 J where we have the expression for the joule (J) in terms of its SI base units of kg, m, and s. In general, the nuclei of stable isotopes have less mass then their constituent subatomic particles. The energy equivalent of this difference is called the binding energy of the nucleus. This energy is released during the formation of the isotope from its constituent particles because the product is more stable than the reactants. Expressed as mass, it is called the mass defect. For example, a helium nucleus is made of two neutrons and two protons and has a mass of 4.0003 atomic mass units (u). The sum of the masses of two protons and two neutrons is 4.0330 u. The mass defect then is 0.0327 u. Converted to kg, the mass defect is 5.0442 × 10–30 kg. Multiplying this mass times c2 gives a binding energy of 4.540 × 10–12 J. This does not sound like much because it is only one atom. If you were to make one gram of helium out of neutrons and protons, it would release 683,000,000,000 J. By comparison, burning one gram of coal releases about 24 J. Teacher Support [BL] In regards to the change in the law of conservation of energy to the law of conservation of mass-energy, it may help to think of mass as simply a very concentrated form of energy. [OL] Impress upon the students the enormous amount of energy derived from the conversion of a small amount of mass. Have them note that c2 is a very large number. Students try to understand new concepts by using previous knowledge, and that may result in a misconception here. They are comfortable with chemical reactions and may try to relate this to the burning of a piece of wood. Tell them that burning the wood chemically might provide energy for a single room in a house, but converting the mass of the wood completely to energy according to E = mc2 would provide power for thousands of houses. [AL] Ask students if they know the difference between fission and fusion and where examples of each of these occur. The RHIC Collider shows the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, NY. The circular structure houses a particle accelerator called the RHIC, which stands for Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. The heavy ions in the name are gold nuclei that have been stripped of their electrons. Streams of ions are accelerated in several stages before entering the big ring seen in the figure. Here, they are accelerated to their final speed, which is about 99.7 percent the speed of light. Such high speeds are called relativistic. All the relativistic phenomena we have been discussing in this chapter are very pronounced in this case. At this speed γ = 12.9, so that relativistic time dilates by a factor of about 13, and relativistic length contracts by the same factor. Brookhaven National Laboratory. The circular structure houses the RHIC. (energy.gov, Wikimedia Commons)Two ion beams circle the 2.4-mile long track around the big ring in opposite directions. The paths can then be made to cross, thereby causing ions to collide. The collision event is very short-lived but amazingly intense. The temperatures and pressures produced are greater than those in the hottest suns. At 4 trillion degrees Celsius, this is the hottest material ever created in a laboratory But what is the point of creating such an extreme event? Under these conditions, the neutrons and protons that make up the gold nuclei are smashed apart into their components, which are called quarks and gluons. The goal is to recreate the conditions that theorists believe existed at the very beginning of the universe. It is thought that, at that time, matter was a sort of soup of quarks and gluons. When things cooled down after the initial bang, these particles condensed to form protons and neutrons. Some of the results have been surprising and unexpected. It was thought the quark-gluon soup would resemble a gas or plasma. Instead, it behaves more like a liquid. It has been called a perfect liquid because it has virtually no viscosity, meaning that it has no resistance to flow. Teacher Support Discuss particle colliders such as the relatively new Large Hadron Collider built by CERN. Students may want to know more about this project and the God particle.

The ship is 50 meters long and is travelling at 95 percent of the speed of light. What would the ship’s length be when measured from your earthbound frame of reference? Strategy List the knowns and unknowns. Knowns: proper length of the ship, L0 = 50 m; velocity, v, = 0.95c Unknowns: observed length of the ship accounting for relativistic length contraction, L.

Be sure to also square the decimal representing the percentage before subtracting from 1. Note that the aliens will still see the length as L0 because they are moving with the frame of reference that is the ship. Teacher Support Identify the variables, the knowns and unknowns, and the relevant equation.

As the speed v of an object moving with respect to a stationary observer approaches c, the length perceived by the observer approaches zero. For other speeds, the length perceived is always less than the proper length. As the speed v of an object moving with respect to a stationary observer approaches c, the length perceived by the observer approaches zero. For other speeds, the length perceived is always greater than the proper length. As the speed v of an object moving with respect to a stationary observer approaches c, the length perceived by the observer approaches infinity.

Performance Task People are fascinated by the possibility of traveling across the universe to discover intelligent life on other planets. To do this, we would have to travel enormous distances. Suppose we could somehow travel at up to 90 percent of the speed of light. The closest star is Alpha Centauri, which is 4.37 light years away. (A light year is the distance light travels in one year.) How long, from the point of view of people on Earth, would it take a space ship to travel to Alpha Centauri and back at 0.9c? How much would the astronauts on the spaceship have aged by the time they got back to Earth? Discuss the problems related to travel to stars that are 20 or 30 light years away.

When we feel warmth, it means that heat is transferring energy to our bodies; when we feel cold, that means heat is transferring energy away from our bodies. Heat transfer is the movement of thermal energy from one place or material to another, and is caused by temperature differences. For example, much of our weather is caused by Earth evening out the temperature across the planet through wind and violent storms, which are driven by heat transferring energy away from the equator towards the cold poles. In this chapter, we’ll explore the precise meaning of heat, how it relates to temperature as well as to other forms of energy, and its connection to work.

Section Key Terms absolute zero Celsius scale degree Celsius ( °C ) thermal energy degree Fahrenheit ( °F ) Fahrenheit scale heat kelvin (K) Kelvin scale temperature Teacher Support [BL] [OL][AL] Check prior knowledge of terms such as heat, temperature, and temperature scales. [OL] Ask students what contains more heat—a bucketful of warm water or a spoonful of boiling water. From this ask them to define heat. Ask them which one has a higher temperature. Dispel any notions that heat content is solely dependent on temperature. TemperatureWhat is temperature? It’s one of those concepts so ingrained in our everyday lives that, although we know what it means intuitively, it can be hard to define. It is tempting to say that temperature measures heat, but this is not strictly true. Heat is the transfer of energy due to a temperature difference. Temperature is defined in terms of the instrument we use to tell us how hot or cold an object is, based on a mechanism and scale invented by people. Temperature is literally defined as what we measure on a thermometer. Heat is often confused with temperature. For example, we may say that the heat was unbearable, when we actually mean that the temperature was high. This is because we are sensitive to the flow of energy by heat, rather than the temperature. Since heat, like work, transfers energy, it has the SI unit of joule (J). Atoms and molecules are constantly in motion, bouncing off one another in random directions. Recall that kinetic energy is the energy of motion, and that it increases in proportion to velocity squared. Without going into mathematical detail, we can say that thermal energy—the energy associated with heat—is the average kinetic energy of the particles (molecules or atoms) in a substance. Faster moving molecules have greater kinetic energies, and so the substance has greater thermal energy, and thus a higher temperature. The total internal energy of a system is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of its atoms and molecules. Thermal energy is one of the subcategories of internal energy, as is chemical energy. Teacher Support You can show that temperature is related to the kinetic energy of molecules by a simple demonstration. Take an eraser and rub it vigorously against any surface. Then feel it against your skin. Is it hot? To measure temperature, some scale must be used as a standard of measurement. The three most commonly used temperature scales are the Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin scales. Both the Fahrenheit scale and Celsius scale are relative temperature scales, meaning that they are made around a reference point. For example, the Celsius scale uses the freezing point of water as its reference point; all measurements are either lower than the freezing point of water by a given number of degrees (and have a negative sign), or higher than the freezing point of water by a given number of degrees (and have a positive sign). The boiling point of water is 100 °C for the Celsius scale, and its unit is the degree Celsius ( °C ). On the Fahrenheit scale, the freezing point of water is at 32 °F , and the boiling point is at 212 °F . The unit of temperature on this scale is the degree Fahrenheit ( °F ). Note that the difference in degrees between the freezing and boiling points is greater for the Fahrenheit scale than for the Celsius scale. Therefore, a temperature difference of one degree Celsius is greater than a temperature difference of one degree Fahrenheit. Since 100 Celsius degrees span the same range as 180 Fahrenheit degrees, one degree on the Celsius scale is 1.8 times larger than one degree on the Fahrenheit scale (because 180 100 = 9 5 =1.8 ). This relationship can be used to convert between temperatures in Fahrenheit and Celsius (see ). Relationships between the Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin temperature scales, rounded to the nearest degree. The relative sizes of the scales are also shown. The Kelvin scale is the temperature scale that is commonly used in science because it is an absolute temperature scale. This means that the theoretically lowest-possible temperature is assigned the value of zero. Zero degrees on the Kelvin scale is known as absolute zero; it is theoretically the point at which there is no molecular motion to produce thermal energy. On the original Kelvin scale first created by Lord Kelvin, all temperatures have positive values, making it useful for scientific work. The official temperature unit on this scale is the kelvin, which is abbreviated as K. The freezing point of water is 273.15 K, and the boiling point of water is 373.15 K. Teacher Support [BL][OL][AL] Ask students in which case each scale would be most convenient to use. Although absolute zero is possible in theory, it cannot be reached in practice. The lowest temperature ever created and measured during a laboratory experiment was 1.0× 10 −10 K, at Helsinki University of Technology in Finland. In comparison, the coldest recorded temperature for a place on Earth’s surface was 183 K (–89 °C ), at Vostok, Antarctica, and the coldest known place (outside the lab) in the universe is the Boomerang Nebula, with a temperature of 1 K. Luckily, most of us humans will never have to experience such extremes. Teacher Support [AL]Ask why absolute zero has never been recorded. Discuss if atoms and molecules can ever be completely motionless. The average normal body temperature is 98.6 °F (37.0 °C ), but people have been known to survive with body temperatures ranging from 75 °F to 111 °F (24 °C to 44 °C ).Comparing Celsius and Fahrenheit Temperature Scales This video shows how the Fahrenheit and Celsius temperature scales compare to one another. Teacher Support Students can use the process described in this video as a means of comparing different temperature scales. Point out to them that all they need to know are the temperatures on each scale of a single property, such as the boiling and freezing points of a liquid, whether it be water, ethanol, or tetrachloromethane. Converting Between Celsius, Kelvin, and Fahrenheit ScalesWhile the Fahrenheit scale is still the most commonly used scale in the United States, the majority of the world uses Celsius, and scientists prefer Kelvin. It’s often necessary to convert between these scales. For instance, if the TV meteorologist gave the local weather report in kelvins, there would likely be some confused viewers! gives the equations for conversion between the three temperature scales.Temperature Conversions To Convert From… Use This Equation Celsius to Fahrenheit T °F = 9 5 T °C +32 Fahrenheit to Celsius T °C = 5 9 ( T °F −32 ) Celsius to Kelvin T K = T °C + 273.15 Kelvin to Celsius T °C = T K −273.15 Fahrenheit to Kelvin T K = 5 9 ( T °F −32 )+273.15 Kelvin to Fahrenheit T °F = 9 5 ( T K −273.15 )+32 Teacher Support [BL][OL][AL] Ask students which is more—a difference of 5°F or a difference of 5°C . Now ask them the same for 5°C and 5°F . A difference in temperature for Kelvin and that for Celsius are the same. The same is not true for Celsius and Fahrenheit. Converting between Temperature Scales: Room Temperature Room temperature is generally defined to be 25 °C . (a) What is room temperature in °F ? (b) What is it in K? Teacher Support In an alcohol-in-glass thermometer, alcohol molecules absorb energy by heat, and as the intermolecular distances increase, the bulk alcohol expands. Ask students the temperature range for which this thermometer shows an accurate reading. Why is this the case? Ask them if it is possible to design a thermometer with any other substance. Why or why not? Strategy To answer these questions, all we need to do is choose the correct conversion equations and plug in the known values. Solution for (a) Choose the right equation. To convert from °C to °F , use the equation T °F = 9 5 T °C +32 . Plug the known value into the equation and solve. T °F = 9 5 25°C+32=77°F Solution for (b) Choose the right equation. To convert from °C to K, use the equation T K = T °C + 273.15 . Plug the known value into the equation and solve. T K = 25 °C + 273.15 = 298K Discussion Living in the United States, you are likely to have more of a sense of what the temperature feels like if it’s described as 77 °F than as 25 °C (or 298 K, for that matter). Converting Between Temperature Scales: The Reaumur Scale The Reaumur scale is a temperature scale that was used widely in Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries. On the Reaumur temperature scale, the freezing point of water is 0 °R and the boiling temperature is 80 °R . If “room temperature” is 25 °C on the Celsius scale, what is it on the Reaumur scale? Strategy To answer this question, we must compare the Reaumur scale to the Celsius scale. The difference between the freezing point and boiling point of water on the Reaumur scale is 80 °R . On the Celsius scale, it is 100 °C . Therefore, 100 °C = 80 °R . Both scales start at 0 ° for freezing, so we can create a simple formula to convert between temperatures on the two scales. Solution Derive a formula to convert from one scale to the other. T °R = 0.80°R °C × T °C Plug the known value into the equation and solve. T °R = 0.80°R °C ×25°C = 20°R Discussion As this example shows, relative temperature scales are somewhat arbitrary. If you wanted, you could create your own temperature scale! Practice Problems What is 12.0 °C in kelvins? 112.0 K 273.2 K 12.0 K 285.2 K What is 32.0 °C in degrees Fahrenheit? 57.6 °F 25.6 °F 305.2 °F 89.6 °F Sometimes it is not so easy to guess the temperature of the air accurately. Why is this? Factors such as humidity and wind speed affect how hot or cold we feel. Wind removes thermal energy from our bodies at a faster rate than usual, making us feel colder than we otherwise would; on a cold day, you may have heard the TV weather person refer to the wind chill. On humid summer days, people tend to feel hotter because sweat doesn’t evaporate from the skin as efficiently as it does on dry days, when the evaporation of sweat cools us off. Teacher Support Ask students how wind chill works. Will it work on any surface or just the human body? The rate of heat loss for any object depends on the temperature difference between the object and its surroundings. When heat transfers energy away from the object, it warms a layer of air around it. Wind disrupts this layer, replacing it with cooler air. This, in turn, increases the rate of heat loss. Wind chill can only increase the rate of cooling. It can never cool an object to a temperature below the ambient temperature. Check Your Understanding Teacher Support Use these questions to assess student achievement of the section’s learning objectives. If students are struggling with a specific objective, these questions will help identify which and direct students to the relevant content. What is used to measure temperature? a galvanometer a manometer a thermometer a voltmeter Section Summary Temperature is the quantity measured by a thermometer. Temperature is related to the average kinetic energy of atoms and molecules in a system. Absolute zero is the temperature at which there is no molecular motion. There are three main temperature scales: Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. Temperatures on one scale can be converted into temperatures on another scale.

The student knows that changes occur within a physical system and applies the laws of conservation of energy and momentum. The student is expected to: (F) contrast and give examples of different processes of thermal energy transfer, including conduction, convection, and radiation. Section Key Terms conduction convection heat capacity radiation specific heat Teacher Support [BL][OL][AL] Review concepts of heat, temperature, and mass. [AL] Check prior knowledge of conduction and convection. Heat Transfer, Specific Heat, and Heat Capacity We learned in the previous section that temperature is proportional to the average kinetic energy of atoms and molecules in a substance, and that the average internal kinetic energy of a substance is higher when the substance’s temperature is higher. If two objects at different temperatures are brought in contact with each other, energy is transferred from the hotter object (that is, the object with the greater temperature) to the colder (lower temperature) object, until both objects are at the same temperature. There is no net heat transfer once the temperatures are equal because the amount of heat transferred from one object to the other is the same as the amount of heat returned. One of the major effects of heat transfer is temperature change: Heating increases the temperature while cooling decreases it. Experiments show that the heat transferred to or from a substance depends on three factors—the change in the substance’s temperature, the mass of the substance, and certain physical properties related to the phase of the substance. The equation for heat transfer Q is Q = mcΔT, where m is the mass of the substance and ΔT is the change in its temperature, in units of Celsius or Kelvin. The symbol c stands for specific heat, and depends on the material and phase. The specific heat is the amount of heat necessary to change the temperature of 1.00 kg of mass by 1.00 ºC. The specific heat c is a property of the substance; its SI unit is J/(kg ⋅ K) or J/(kg ⋅ °C ). The temperature change ( ΔT ) is the same in units of kelvins and degrees Celsius (but not degrees Fahrenheit). Specific heat is closely related to the concept of heat capacity. Heat capacity is the amount of heat necessary to change the temperature of a substance by 1.00 °C . In equation form, heat capacity C is C=mc , where m is mass and c is specific heat. Note that heat capacity is the same as specific heat, but without any dependence on mass. Consequently, two objects made up of the same material but with different masses will have different heat capacities. This is because the heat capacity is a property of an object, but specific heat is a property of any object made of the same material.Values of specific heat must be looked up in tables, because there is no simple way to calculate them. gives the values of specific heat for a few substances as a handy reference. We see from this table that the specific heat of water is five times that of glass, which means that it takes five times as much heat to raise the temperature of 1 kg of water than to raise the temperature of 1 kg of glass by the same number of degrees.Teacher Support [BL][OL][AL]Explain that this formula only works when there is no change in phase of the substance. The transfer of thermal energy, heat, and phase change will be covered later in the chapter. The units of specific heat are J/(kg ⋅°C ) and J/(kg ⋅ K). However, degrees Celsius and Kelvins are not always interchangeable. The formula for specific heat uses a difference in temperature and not absolute temperature. This is the reason that degrees Celsius may be used in place of Kelvins. Specific Heats of Various Substances.

You will answer this question by taking measurements to study differences in specific heat capacity. Open flame—Tie back all loose hair and clothing before igniting an open flame. Follow all of your teacher's instructions on how to ignite the flame. Never leave an open flame unattended. Know the location of fire safety equipment in the laboratory. Sand or soil Water Oven or heat lamp Two small jars Two thermometers Instructions Procedure Place equal masses of dry sand (or soil) and water at the same temperature into two small jars. (The average density of soil or sand is about 1.6 times that of water, so you can get equal masses by using 50 percent more water by volume.) Heat both substances (using an oven or a heat lamp) for the same amount of time. Record the final temperatures of the two masses. Now bring both jars to the same temperature by heating for a longer period of time. Remove the jars from the heat source and measure their temperature every 5 minutes for about 30 minutes. Conduction, Convection, and RadiationWhenever there is a temperature difference, heat transfer occurs. Heat transfer may happen rapidly, such as through a cooking pan, or slowly, such as through the walls of an insulated cooler. There are three different heat transfer methods: conduction, convection, and radiation. At times, all three may happen simultaneously. See . In a fireplace, heat transfer occurs by all three methods: conduction, convection, and radiation. Radiation is responsible for most of the heat transferred into the room. Heat transfer also occurs through conduction into the room, but at a much slower rate. Heat transfer by convection also occurs through cold air entering the room around windows and hot air leaving the room by rising up the chimney.Conduction is heat transfer through direct physical contact. Heat transferred between the electric burner of a stove and the bottom of a pan is transferred by conduction. Sometimes, we try to control the conduction of heat to make ourselves more comfortable. Since the rate of heat transfer is different for different materials, we choose fabrics, such as a thick wool sweater, that slow down the transfer of heat away from our bodies in winter. As you walk barefoot across the living room carpet, your feet feel relatively comfortable…until you step onto the kitchen’s tile floor. Since the carpet and tile floor are both at the same temperature, why does one feel colder than the other? This is explained by different rates of heat transfer: The tile material removes heat from your skin at a greater rate than the carpeting, which makes it feel colder. Teacher Support [BL][OL][AL] Ask students what the current temperature in the classroom is. Ask them if all the objects in the room are at the same temperature. Once this is established, ask them to place their hand on their desk or on a metal object. Does it feel colder? Why? If their desk is Formica laminate, then it will feel cool to their hand because the laminate is a good conductor of heat and draws heat from their hand creating a sensation of “cold” due to heat leaving the body. Some materials simply conduct thermal energy faster than others. In general, metals (like copper, aluminum, gold, and silver) are good heat conductors, whereas materials like wood, plastic, and rubber are poor heat conductors. shows particles (either atoms or molecules) in two bodies at different temperatures. The (average) kinetic energy of a particle in the hot body is higher than in the colder body. If two particles collide, energy transfers from the particle with greater kinetic energy to the particle with less kinetic energy. When two bodies are in contact, many particle collisions occur, resulting in a net flux of heat from the higher-temperature body to the lower-temperature body. The heat flux depends on the temperature difference ΔT= T hot − T cold . Therefore, you will get a more severe burn from boiling water than from hot tap water. The particles in two bodies at different temperatures have different average kinetic energies. Collisions occurring at the contact surface tend to transfer energy from high-temperature regions to low-temperature regions. In this illustration, a particle in the lower-temperature region (right side) has low kinetic energy before collision, but its kinetic energy increases after colliding with the contact surface. In contrast, a particle in the higher-temperature region (left side) has more kinetic energy before collision, but its energy decreases after colliding with the contact surface. Convection is heat transfer by the movement of a fluid. This type of heat transfer happens, for example, in a pot boiling on the stove, or in thunderstorms, where hot air rises up to the base of the clouds. In everyday language, the term fluid is usually taken to mean liquid. For example, when you are sick and the doctor tells you to “push fluids,” that only means to drink more beverages—not to breath more air. However, in physics, fluid means a liquid or a gas. Fluids move differently than solid material, and even have their own branch of physics, known as fluid dynamics, that studies how they move. As the temperature of fluids increase, they expand and become less dense. For example, could represent the wall of a balloon with different temperature gases inside the balloon than outside in the environment. The hotter and thus faster moving gas particles inside the balloon strike the surface with more force than the cooler air outside, causing the balloon to expand. This decrease in density relative to its environment creates buoyancy (the tendency to rise). Convection is driven by buoyancy—hot air rises because it is less dense than the surrounding air. Sometimes, we control the temperature of our homes or ourselves by controlling air movement. Sealing leaks around doors with weather stripping keeps out the cold wind in winter. The house in and the pot of water on the stove in are both examples of convection and buoyancy by human design. Ocean currents and large-scale atmospheric circulation transfer energy from one part of the globe to another, and are examples of natural convection. Air heated by the so-called gravity furnace expands and rises, forming a convective loop that transfers energy to other parts of the room. As the air is cooled at the ceiling and outside walls, it contracts, eventually becoming denser than room air and sinking to the floor. A properly designed heating system like this one, which uses natural convection, can be quite efficient in uniformly heating a home. Convection plays an important role in heat transfer inside this pot of water. Once conducted to the inside fluid, heat transfer to other parts of the pot is mostly by convection. The hotter water expands, decreases in density, and rises to transfer heat to other regions of the water, while colder water sinks to the bottom. This process repeats as long as there is water in the pot.Radiation is a form of heat transfer that occurs when electromagnetic radiation is emitted or absorbed. Electromagnetic radiation includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma rays, all of which have different wavelengths and amounts of energy (shorter wavelengths have higher frequency and more energy). Teacher Support [BL][OL] Electromagnetic waves are also often referred to as EM waves. We perceive EM waves of different frequencies differently. Just as we are able to see certain frequencies as visible light, we perceive certain others as heat. You can feel the heat transfer from a fire and from the sun. Similarly, you can sometimes tell that the oven is hot without touching its door or looking inside—it may just warm you as you walk by. Another example is thermal radiation from the human body; people are constantly emitting infrared radiation, which is not visible to the human eye, but is felt as heat. Radiation is the only method of heat transfer where no medium is required, meaning that the heat doesn’t need to come into direct contact with or be transported by any matter. The space between Earth and the sun is largely empty, without any possibility of heat transfer by convection or conduction. Instead, heat is transferred by radiation, and Earth is warmed as it absorbs electromagnetic radiation emitted by the sun. Most of the heat transfer from this fire to the observers is through infrared radiation. The visible light transfers relatively little thermal energy. Since skin is very sensitive to infrared radiation, you can sense the presence of a fire without looking at it directly. (Daniel X. O’Neil) All objects absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation (see ). The rate of heat transfer by radiation depends mainly on the color of the object. Black is the most effective absorber and radiator, and white is the least effective. People living in hot climates generally avoid wearing black clothing, for instance. Similarly, black asphalt in a parking lot will be hotter than adjacent patches of grass on a summer day, because black absorbs better than green. The reverse is also true—black radiates better than green. On a clear summer night, the black asphalt will be colder than the green patch of grass, because black radiates energy faster than green. In contrast, white is a poor absorber and also a poor radiator. A white object reflects nearly all radiation, like a mirror. Teacher Support Ask students to give examples of conduction, convection, and radiation. Energy Forms and Changes In this animation, you will explore heat transfer with different materials. Experiment with heating and cooling the iron, brick, and water. This is done by dragging and dropping the object onto the pedestal and then holding the lever either to Heat or Cool. Drag a thermometer beside each object to measure its temperature—you can watch how quickly it heats or cools in real time. Now let’s try transferring heat between objects. Heat the brick and then place it in the cool water. Now heat the brick again, but then place it on top of the iron. What do you notice? Selecting the fast forward option lets you speed up the heat transfers, to save time. Teacher Support Have students consider the differences in the interactive exercise results if different materials were used. For example, ask them whether the temperature change would be greater or smaller if the brick were replaced with a block of iron with the same mass as the brick. Ask students to consider identical masses of the metals aluminum, gold, and copper. After they have stated whether the temperature change is greater or less for each metal, have them refer to and check whether their predictions were correct. Solving Heat Transfer Problems Calculating the Required Heat: Heating Water in an Aluminum Pan A 0.500 kg aluminum pan on a stove is used to heat 0.250 L of water from 20.0 °C to 80.0 °C . (a) How much heat is required? What percentage of the heat is used to raise the temperature of (b) the pan and (c) the water? Strategy The pan and the water are always at the same temperature. When you put the pan on the stove, the temperature of the water and the pan is increased by the same amount. We use the equation for heat transfer for the given temperature change and masses of water and aluminum. The specific heat values for water and aluminum are given in the previous table. Solution to (a) Because the water is in thermal contact with the aluminum, the pan and the water are at the same temperature. Calculate the temperature difference. ΔT= T f − T i =60.0°C Calculate the mass of water using the relationship between density, mass, and volume. Density is mass per unit volume, or ρ= m V . Rearranging this equation, solve for the mass of water. m w =ρ⋅V=1000 kg/m 3 ×( 0.250 L× 0 .001 m 3 1 L )=0.250 kg Calculate the heat transferred to the water. Use the specific heat of water in the previous table. Q w = m w c w ΔT= ( 0.250 kg )( 4186 J/kg°C )( 60.0°C ) = 62.8 kJ Calculate the heat transferred to the aluminum. Use the specific heat for aluminum in the previous table. Q Al = m Al c Al ΔT= ( 0.500 kg )( 900 J/kg°C )( 60.0°C ) = 27 .0 ×10 3 J = 27.0 kJ Find the total transferred heat. Q Total = Q w + Q Al = 62.8 kJ + 27.0 kJ = 89.8 kJ Solution to (b) The percentage of heat going into heating the pan is 27.0 kJ 89.8 kJ ×100%=30.1% Solution to (c) The percentage of heat going into heating the water is 62.8 kJ 89.8 kJ ×100%=69.9% Discussion In this example, most of the total heat transferred is used to heat the water, even though the pan has twice as much mass. This is because the specific heat of water is over four times greater than the specific heat of aluminum. Therefore, it takes a bit more than twice as much heat to achieve the given temperature change for the water than for the aluminum pan. Water can absorb a tremendous amount of energy with very little resulting temperature change. This property of water allows for life on Earth because it stabilizes temperatures. Other planets are less habitable because wild temperature swings make for a harsh environment. You may have noticed that climates closer to large bodies of water, such as oceans, are milder than climates landlocked in the middle of a large continent. This is due to the climate-moderating effect of water’s large heat capacity—water stores large amounts of heat during hot weather and releases heat gradually when it’s cold outside. Calculating Temperature Increase: Truck Brakes Overheat on Downhill Runs When a truck headed downhill brakes, the brakes must do work to convert the gravitational potential energy of the truck to internal energy of the brakes. This conversion prevents the gravitational potential energy from being converted into kinetic energy of the truck, and keeps the truck from speeding up and losing control. The increased internal energy of the brakes raises their temperature. When the hill is especially steep, the temperature increase may happen too quickly and cause the brakes to overheat. Calculate the temperature increase of 100 kg of brake material with an average specific heat of 800 J/kg ⋅°C from a 10,000 kg truck descending 75.0 m (in vertical displacement) at a constant speed. Strategy We first calculate the gravitational potential energy (Mgh) of the truck, and then find the temperature increase produced in the brakes. Solution Calculate the change in gravitational potential energy as the truck goes downhill. Mgh=( 10,000 kg )(9 .80 m/s 2 )( 75.0 m )=7.35× 10 6 J Calculate the temperature change from the heat transferred by rearranging the equation Q = mcΔT to solve for ΔT. ΔT= Q mc , where m is the mass of the brake material (not the entire truck). Insert the values Q = 7.35×106 J (since the heat transfer is equal to the change in gravitational potential energy), m = 100 kg, and c = 800 J/kg ⋅ °C to find ΔT= 7.35× 10 6 J (100kg)(800 J/kg ⋅°C) =91.9°C. Discussion This temperature is close to the boiling point of water. If the truck had been traveling for some time, then just before the descent, the brake temperature would likely be higher than the ambient temperature. The temperature increase in the descent would likely raise the temperature of the brake material above the boiling point of water, which would be hard on the brakes. This is why truck drivers sometimes use a different technique for called “engine braking” to avoid burning their brakes during steep descents. Engine braking is using the slowing forces of an engine in low gear rather than brakes to slow down.

True or falseConduction and convection cannot happen simultaneously True False Section Summary Heat is thermal (internal) energy transferred due to a temperature difference. The transfer of heat Q that leads to a change ΔT in the temperature of a body with mass m is Q=mcΔT , where c is the specific heat of the material. Heat is transferred by three different methods: conduction, convection, and radiation. Heat conduction is the transfer of heat between two objects in direct contact with each other. Convection is heat transfer by the movement of mass. Radiation is heat transfer by electromagnetic waves. Key Equations heat transfer Q = mcΔT density ρ= m V Concept Items Critical Thinking The value of specific heat is the same whether the units are J/kg⋅K or J/kg⋅ºC. How? Temperature difference is dependent on the chosen temperature scale. Temperature change is different in units of kelvins and degrees Celsius.

The student knows that changes occur within a physical system and applies the laws of conservation of energy and momentum. The student is expected to: (E) describe how the macroscopic properties of a thermodynamic system such as temperature, specific heat, and pressure are related to the molecular level of matter, including kinetic or potential energy of atoms; (F) contrast and give examples of different processes of thermal energy transfer, including conduction, convection, and radiation. Section Key Terms condensation freezing latent heat sublimation latent heat of fusion latent heat of vaporization melting vaporization phase change phase diagram plasma Teacher Support Introduce this section by asking students to give examples of solids, liquids, and gases. Phase Changes So far, we have learned that adding thermal energy by heat increases the temperature of a substance. But surprisingly, there are situations where adding energy does not change the temperature of a substance at all! Instead, the additional thermal energy acts to loosen bonds between molecules or atoms and causes a phase change. Because this energy enters or leaves a system during a phase change without causing a temperature change in the system, it is known as latent heat (latent means hidden). The three phases of matter that you frequently encounter are solid, liquid and gas (see ). Solid has the least energetic state; atoms in solids are in close contact, with forces between them that allow the particles to vibrate but not change position with neighboring particles. (These forces can be thought of as springs that can be stretched or compressed, but not easily broken.) Liquid has a more energetic state, in which particles can slide smoothly past one another and change neighbors, although they are still held together by their mutual attraction. Gas has a more energetic state than liquid, in which particles are broken free of their bonds. Particles in gases are separated by distances that are large compared with the size of the particles. The most energetic state of all is plasma. Although you may not have heard much about plasma, it is actually the most common state of matter in the universe—stars are made up of plasma, as is lightning. The plasma state is reached by heating a gas to the point where particles are pulled apart, separating the electrons from the rest of the particle. This produces an ionized gas that is a combination of the negatively charged free electrons and positively charged ions, known as plasma. (a) Particles in a solid always have the same neighbors, held close by forces represented here by springs. These particles are essentially in contact with one another. A rock is an example of a solid. This rock retains its shape because of the forces holding its atoms or molecules together. (b) Particles in a liquid are also in close contact but can slide over one another. Forces between them strongly resist attempts to push them closer together and also hold them in close contact. Water is an example of a liquid. Water can flow, but it also remains in an open container because of the forces between its molecules. (c) Particles in a gas are separated by distances that are considerably larger than the size of the particles themselves, and they move about freely. A gas must be held in a closed container to prevent it from moving out into its surroundings. (d) The atmosphere is ionized in the extreme heat of a lightning strike.During a phase change, matter changes from one phase to another, either through the addition of energy by heat and the transition to a more energetic state, or from the removal of energy by heat and the transition to a less energetic state. Phase changes to a more energetic state include the following: Melting—Solid to liquid Vaporization—Liquid to gas (included boiling and evaporation) Sublimation—Solid to gas IonizationGas to plasma Phase changes to a less energetic state are as follows: Condensation—Gas to liquid Freezing—Liquid to solid Recombination—Plasma to gas DepositionGas to solid Energy is required to melt a solid because the bonds between the particles in the solid must be broken. Since the energy involved in a phase changes is used to break bonds, there is no increase in the kinetic energies of the particles, and therefore no rise in temperature. Similarly, energy is needed to vaporize a liquid to overcome the attractive forces between particles in the liquid. There is no temperature change until a phase change is completed. The temperature of a cup of soda and ice that is initially at 0 °C stays at 0 °C until all of the ice has melted. In the reverse of these processes—freezing and condensation—energy is released from the latent heat (see ). Teacher Support [BL][OL] Ask students if the same amount of energy is absorbed or released in melting or freezing a particular quantity of a substance. [AL] Ask student how water is able to evaporate even when it is at room temperature and not at 100 °C . (a) Energy is required to partially overcome the attractive forces between particles in a solid to form a liquid. That same energy must be removed for freezing to take place. (b) Particles are separated by large distances when changing from liquid to vapor, requiring significant energy to overcome molecular attraction. The same energy must be removed for condensation to take place. There is no temperature change until a phase change is completed. (c) Enough energy is added that the liquid state is skipped over completely as a substance undergoes sublimation. The heat, Q, required to change the phase of a sample of mass m is Q=m L f (for melting/freezing), Q=m L v (for vaporization/condensation),where L f is the latent heat of fusion, and L v is the latent heat of vaporization. The latent heat of fusion is the amount of heat needed to cause a phase change between solid and liquid. The latent heat of vaporization is the amount of heat needed to cause a phase change between liquid and gas. L f and L v are coefficients that vary from substance to substance, depending on the strength of intermolecular forces, and both have standard units of J/kg. See for values of L f and L v of different substances.

A phase diagram indicating the temperature changes of water as energy is added is shown in . The ice starts out at −20 °C , and its temperature rises linearly, absorbing heat at a constant rate until it reaches 0 ° . Once at this temperature, the ice gradually melts, absorbing 334 kJ/kg. The temperature remains constant at 0 °C during this phase change. Once all the ice has melted, the temperature of the liquid water rises, absorbing heat at a new constant rate. At 100 °C , the water begins to boil and the temperature again remains constant while the water absorbs 2256 kJ/kg during this phase change. When all the liquid has become steam, the temperature rises again at a constant rate. A graph of temperature versus added energy. The system is constructed so that no vapor forms while ice warms to become liquid water, and so when vaporization occurs, the vapor remains in the system. The long stretches of constant temperature values at 0 °C and 100 °C reflect the large latent heats of melting and vaporization, respectively.We have seen that vaporization requires heat transfer to a substance from its surroundings. Condensation is the reverse process, where heat in transferred away from a substance to its surroundings. This release of latent heat increases the temperature of the surroundings. Energy must be removed from the condensing particles to make a vapor condense. This is why condensation occurs on cold surfaces: the heat transfers energy away from the warm vapor to the cold surface. The energy is exactly the same as that required to cause the phase change in the other direction, from liquid to vapor, and so it can be calculated from Q=m L v . Latent heat is also released into the environment when a liquid freezes, and can be calculated from Q=m L f . Making Ice Cream With the proper ingredients, some ice and a couple of plastic bags, you could make your own ice cream in five minutes. (ElinorD, Wikimedia Commons)Ice cream is certainly easy enough to buy at the supermarket, but for the hardcore ice cream enthusiast, that may not be satisfying enough. Going through the process of making your own ice cream lets you invent your own flavors and marvel at the physics firsthand (). The first step to making homemade ice cream is to mix heavy cream, whole milk, sugar, and your flavor of choice; it could be as simple as cocoa powder or vanilla extract, or as fancy as pomegranates or pistachios. The next step is to pour the mixture into a container that is deep enough that you will be able to churn the mixture without it spilling over, and that is also freezer-safe. After placing it in the freezer, the ice cream has to be stirred vigorously every 45 minutes for four to five hours. This slows the freezing process and prevents the ice cream from turning into a solid block of ice. Most people prefer a soft creamy texture instead of one giant popsicle. As it freezes, the cream undergoes a phase change from liquid to solid. By now, we’re experienced enough to know that this means that the cream must experience a loss of heat. Where does that heat go? Due to the temperature difference between the freezer and the ice cream mixture, heat transfers thermal energy from the ice cream to the air in the freezer. Once the temperature in the freezer rises enough, the freezer is cooled by pumping excess heat outside into the kitchen. A faster way to make ice cream is to chill it by placing the mixture in a plastic bag, surrounded by another plastic bag half full of ice. (You can also add a teaspoon of salt to the outer bag to lower the temperature of the ice/salt mixture.) Shaking the bag for five minutes churns the ice cream while cooling it evenly. In this case, the heat transfers energy out of the ice cream mixture and into the ice during the phase change. This video gives a demonstration of how to make home-made ice cream using ice and plastic bags. Solving Thermal Energy Problems with Phase ChangesCalculating Heat Required for a Phase Change Calculate a) how much energy is needed to melt 1.000 kg of ice at 0 °C (freezing point), and b) how much energy is required to vaporize 1.000 kg of water at 100 °C (boiling point). Strategy FOR (A) Using the equation for the heat required for melting, and the value of the latent heat of fusion of water from the previous table, we can solve for part (a). Solution to (a) The energy to melt 1.000 kg of ice is Q=m L f =( 1.000 kg )( 334 kJ/kg )=334 kJ. Strategy FOR (B) To solve part (b), we use the equation for heat required for vaporization, along with the latent heat of vaporization of water from the previous table. Solution to (b) The energy to vaporize 1.000 kg of liquid water is Q=m L v =( 1.000 kg )( 2256 kJ/kg )=2256 kJ. Discussion The amount of energy need to melt a kilogram of ice (334 kJ) is the same amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of 1.000 kg of liquid water from 0 °C to 79.8 °C . This example shows that the energy for a phase change is enormous compared to energy associated with temperature changes. It also demonstrates that the amount of energy needed for vaporization is even greater. Calculating Final Temperature from Phase Change: Cooling Soda with Ice Cubes Ice cubes are used to chill a soda at 20 °C and with a mass of m soda =0.25 kg . The ice is at 0 °C and the total mass of the ice cubes is 0.018 kg. Assume that the soda is kept in a foam container so that heat loss can be ignored, and that the soda has the same specific heat as water. Find the final temperature when all of the ice has melted. Strategy The ice cubes are at the melting temperature of 0 °C . Heat is transferred from the soda to the ice for melting. Melting of ice occurs in two steps: first, the phase change occurs and solid (ice) transforms into liquid water at the melting temperature; then, the temperature of this water rises. Melting yields water at 0 °C , so more heat is transferred from the soda to this water until they are the same temperature. Since the amount of heat leaving the soda is the same as the amount of heat transferred to the ice. Q ice =− Q soda The heat transferred to the ice goes partly toward the phase change (melting), and partly toward raising the temperature after melting. Recall from the last section that the relationship between heat and temperature change is Q=mcΔT . For the ice, the temperature change is T f −0°C . The total heat transferred to the ice is therefore Q ice = m ice L f + m ice c w ( T f −0°C). Since the soda doesn’t change phase, but only temperature, the heat given off by the soda is Q soda = m soda c w ( T f −20°C). Since Q ice =− Q soda , m ice L f + m ice c w ( T f −0°C)=− m soda c w ( T f −20°C). Bringing all terms involving T f to the left-hand-side of the equation, and all other terms to the right-hand-side, we can solve for T f . T f = m soda c w (20°C)− m ice L f ( m soda + m ice ) c w Substituting the known quantities T f = ( 0.25 kg )( 4186 J/kg⋅°C )( 20°C )−( 0.018 kg )( 334,000 J/kg ) ( 0.25 kg + 0.018 kg )( 4186 K/kg⋅°C ) =13°C Discussion This example shows the enormous energies involved during a phase change. The mass of the ice is about 7 percent the mass of the soda, yet it causes a noticeable change in the soda’s temperature. If the ice were not already at the freezing point, we would also have to factor in how much energy would go into raising its temperature up to 0 °C , before the phase change occurs. This would be a realistic scenario, because the temperature of ice is often below 0 °C .

In which phases of matter are molecules capable of changing their positions? gas, liquid, solid liquid, plasma, solid liquid, gas, plasma plasma, gas, solid Section Summary Most substances have four distinct phases: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. Gas is the most energetic state and solid is the least. During a phase change, a substance undergoes transition to a higher energy state when heat is added, or to a lower energy state when heat is removed. Heat is added to a substance during melting and vaporization. Latent heat is released by a substance during condensation and freezing. Phase changes occur at fixed temperatures called boiling and freezing (or melting) points for a given substance.

Before the start of the chapter, review the concepts of heat, heat transfer, and internal energy of a system. [BL] Ask students what they think the word efficiency means. Ask them what it means for them to be efficient when performing classwork. Ask whether there are some days when they are more or less efficient than others, and have them give examples. [OL][AL] Ask students why when they touch a machine, such as a computer or auto engine, it feels warm (or very hot!) to the touch. Then explain that, in physics, efficiency is defined as the amount of useful output energy (usually work) for a given input energy. In any engine, including humans, some energy is used to make the engine run, while the rest is lost in the form of unused heat. This is why any device or machine might feel hot while under operation. Point out that if an engine gives more output (say, the energy to travel a certain number of miles) for a given input (the chemical potential energy of the fuel), it is said to be more efficient. People constantly strive to design machines that give more and more efficiency. However, it is impossible for an engine to be 100 percent efficient. Some energy will always be lost in the form of heat. Energy can be transferred to or from a system, either through a temperature difference between it and another system (i.e., by heat) or by exerting a force through a distance (work). In these ways, energy can be converted into other forms of energy in other systems. For example, a car engine burns fuel for heat transfer into a gas. Work is done by the gas as it exerts a force through a distance by pushing a piston outward. This work converts the energy into a variety of other forms—into an increase in the car’s kinetic or gravitational potential energy; into electrical energy to run the spark plugs, radio, and lights; and back into stored energy in the car’s battery. But most of the thermal energy transferred by heat from the fuel burning in the engine does not do work on the gas. Instead, much of this energy is released into the surroundings at lower temperature (i.e., lost through heat), which is quite inefficient. Car engines are only about 25 to 30 percent efficient. This inefficiency leads to increased fuel costs, so there is great interest in improving fuel efficiency. However, it is common knowledge that modern gasoline engines cannot be made much more efficient. The same is true about the conversion to electrical energy in large power stations, whether they are coal, oil, natural gas, or nuclear powered. Why is this the case? The answer lies in the nature of heat. Basic physical laws govern how heat transfer for doing work takes place and limit the maximum possible efficiency of the process. This chapter will explore these laws as well their applications to everyday machines. These topics are part of thermodynamics—the study of heat and its relationship to doing work.

Section Key Terms thermal equilibrium zeroth law of thermodynamics Teacher Support [BL][OL] Review the concept of heat as the transfer of energy due to a temperature difference. [OL] Ask students what the direction of heat flow would be if an ice cube were melting in a glass of soda or if a glass of hot water were placed in a room. Give a few more examples. Ask students how long the heat transfer would take place. What causes the heat transfer to occur? We learned in the previous chapter that when two objects (or systems) are in contact with one another, heat will transfer thermal energy from the object at higher temperature to the one at lower temperature until they both reach the same temperature. The objects are then in thermal equilibrium, and no further temperature changes will occur if they are isolated from other systems. The systems interact and change because their temperatures are different, and the changes stop once their temperatures are the same. Thermal equilibrium is established when two bodies are in thermal contact with each other—meaning heat transfer (i.e., the transfer of energy by heat) can occur between them. If two systems cannot freely exchange energy, they will not reach thermal equilibrium. (It is fortunate that empty space stands between Earth and the sun, because a state of thermal equilibrium with the sun would be too toasty for life on this planet!) If two systems, A and B, are in thermal equilibrium with each other, and B is in thermal equilibrium with a third system, C, then A is also in thermal equilibrium with C. This statement may seem obvious, because all three have the same temperature, but it is basic to thermodynamics. It is called the zeroth law of thermodynamics. Teacher Support [AL] Ask students how we receive the energy of the sun, and yet the sun and Earth never reach thermal equilibrium. The zeroth law of thermodynamics is very similar to the transitive property of equality in mathematics: If a = b and b = c, then a = c. You may be wondering at this point, why the wacky name? Shouldn’t this be called the first law of thermodynamics rather than the zeroth? The explanation is that this law was discovered after the first and second laws of thermodynamics but is so fundamental that scientists decided it should logically come first. As an example of the zeroth law in action, consider newborn babies in neonatal intensive-care units in hospitals. Prematurely born or sick newborns are placed in special incubators. These babies have very little covering while in the incubators, so to an observer, they look as though they may not be warm enough. However, inside the incubator, the temperature of the air, the cot, and the baby are all the same—that is, they are in thermal equilibrium. The ambient temperature is just high enough to keep the baby safe and comfortable. Teacher Support [OL][AL] Ask students to come up with more everyday examples of heat transfer that demonstrate the zeroth law of thermodynamics. Thermodynamics Engineer Thermodynamics engineers apply the principles of thermodynamics to mechanical systems so as to create or test products that rely on the interactions between heat, work, pressure, temperature, and volume. This type of work typically takes place in the aerospace industry, chemical manufacturing companies, industrial manufacturing plants, power plants (), engine manufacturers, or electronics companies. An engineer makes a site visit to the Baghdad South power plant. The need for energy creates quite a bit of demand for thermodynamics engineers, because both traditional energy companies and alternative (green) energy startups rely on interactions between heat and work and so require the expertise of thermodynamics engineers. Traditional energy companies use mainly nuclear energy and energy from burning fossil fuels, such as coal. Alternative energy is finding new ways to harness renewable and, often, more readily available energy sources, such as solar, water, wind, and bio-energy. A thermodynamics engineer in the energy industry can find the most efficient way to turn the burning of a biofuel or fossil fuel into energy, store that energy for times when it’s needed most, or figure out how to best deliver that energy from where it’s produced to where it’s used: in homes, factories, and businesses. Additionally, he or she might also design pollution-control equipment to remove harmful pollutants from the smoke produced as a by-product of burning fuel. For example, a thermodynamics engineer may develop a way to remove mercury from burning coal in a coal-fired power plant. Thermodynamics engineering is an expanding field, where employment opportunities are expected to grow by as much as 27 percent between 2012 and 2022, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. To become a thermodynamics engineer, you must have a college degree in chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, environmental engineering, aerospace engineering, civil engineering, or biological engineering (depending on which type of career you wish to pursue), with coursework in physics and physical chemistry that focuses on thermodynamics. What would be an example of something a thermodynamics engineer would do in the aeronautics industry? Test the fuel efficiency of a jet engine Test the functioning of landing gear Test the functioning of a lift control device Test the autopilot functions Check Your Understanding Teacher Support Use these questions to assess student achievement of the section’s Learning Objectives. If students are struggling with a specific objective, these questions will help identify which and direct students to the relevant content. What is the zeroth law of thermodynamics? Energy can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. If two systems, A and B, are in thermal equilibrium with each other, and B is in thermal equilibrium with a third system, C, then A is also in thermal equilibrium with C. Entropy of any isolated system not in thermal equilibrium always increases. Entropy of a system approaches a constant value as temperature approaches absolute zero. Section Summary Systems are in thermal equilibrium when they have the same temperature. Thermal equilibrium occurs when two bodies are in contact with each other and can freely exchange energy. The zeroth law of thermodynamics states that when two systems, A and B, are in thermal equilibrium with each other, and B is in thermal equilibrium with a third system, C, then A is also in thermal equilibrium with C.

Section Key Terms Boltzmann constant first law of thermodynamics ideal gas law internal energy pressure Pressure, Volume, Temperature, and the Ideal Gas Law Teacher Support [BL][OL][AL] Review the concept of force. [OL] Ask students how much force it would take to hammer a nail into a wall. Would they achieve the same result if the nail were blunt instead of pointed? Why or why not? Before covering the first law of thermodynamics, it is first important to understand the relationship between pressure, volume, and temperature. Pressure, P, is defined as P= F A , where F is a force applied to an area, A, that is perpendicular to the force. Depending on the area over which it is exerted, a given force can have a significantly different effect, as shown in . (a) Although the person being poked with the finger might be irritated, the force has little lasting effect. (b) In contrast, the same force applied to an area the size of the sharp end of a needle is great enough to break the skin. The SI unit for pressure is the pascal, where 1 Pa= 1 N/m 2 . Pressure is defined for all states of matter but is particularly important when discussing fluids (such as air). You have probably heard the word pressure being used in relation to blood (high or low blood pressure) and in relation to the weather (high- and low-pressure weather systems). These are only two of many examples of pressures in fluids. The relationship between the pressure, volume, and temperature for an ideal gas is given by the ideal gas law. A gas is considered ideal at low pressure and fairly high temperature, and forces between its component particles can be ignored. The ideal gas law states that PV=NkT. where P is the pressure of a gas, V is the volume it occupies, N is the number of particles (atoms or molecules) in the gas, and T is its absolute temperature. The constant k is called the Boltzmann constant and has the value k=1.38× 10 −23 J/K, For the purposes of this chapter, we will not go into calculations using the ideal gas law. Instead, it is important for us to notice from the equation that the following are true for a given mass of gas: When volume is constant, pressure is directly proportional to temperature. When temperature is constant, pressure is inversely proportional to volume. When pressure is constant, volume is directly proportional to temperature. This last point describes thermal expansion—the change in size or volume of a given mass with temperature. What is the underlying cause of thermal expansion? An increase in temperature means that there’s an increase in the kinetic energy of the individual atoms. Gases are especially affected by thermal expansion, although liquids expand to a lesser extent with similar increases in temperature, and even solids have minor expansions at higher temperatures. This is why railroad tracks and bridges have expansion joints that allow them to freely expand and contract with temperature changes. Teacher Support [BL][OL][AL]Inform students that the ideal gas law is only strictly true for gases that are ideal. Real gases differ from these in certain ways. For instance, it is assumed that in an ideal gas, there are no intermolecular forces, all collisions between molecules are perfectly elastic, and so on. However, the ideal gas law is useful in calculations, because under standard conditions of temperature and pressure, many real gases, such as oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, and noble gases exhibit qualitative behavior that is very close to the behavior of an ideal gas. To get some idea of how pressure, temperature, and volume of a gas are related to one another, consider what happens when you pump air into a deflated tire. The tire’s volume first increases in direct proportion to the amount of air injected, without much increase in the tire pressure. Once the tire has expanded to nearly its full size, the walls limit volume expansion. If you continue to pump air into tire (which now has a nearly constant volume), the pressure increases with increasing temperature (see ). (a) When air is pumped into a deflated tire, its volume first increases without much increase in pressure. (b) When the tire is filled to a certain point, the tire walls resist further expansion, and the pressure increases as more air is added. (c) Once the tire is inflated fully, its pressure increases with temperature. Pressure–Volume WorkPressure–volume work is the work that is done by the compression or expansion of a fluid. Whenever there is a change in volume and external pressure remains constant, pressure–volume work is taking place. During a compression, a decrease in volume increases the internal pressure of a system as work is done on the system. During an expansion (), an increase in volume decreases the internal pressure of a system as the system does work. An expansion of a gas requires energy transfer to keep the pressure constant. Because pressure is constant, the work done is PΔV . Recall that the formula for work is W=Fd. We can rearrange the definition of pressure, P= F A , to get an expression for force in terms of pressure. F=PA Substituting this expression for force into the definition of work, we get W=PAd. Because area multiplied by displacement is the change in volume, W=PΔV , the mathematical expression for pressure–volume work is W=PΔV. Just as we say that work is force acting over a distance, for fluids, we can say that work is the pressure acting through the change in volume. For pressure–volume work, pressure is analogous to force, and volume is analogous to distance in the traditional definition of work. Work from Expansion This video describes work from expansion (or pressure–volume work). Sal combines the equations W=PΔV and ΔU=Q−W to get ΔU=Q−PΔV . If the volume of a system increases while pressure remains constant, is the value of work done by the system W positive or negative? Will this increase or decrease the internal energy of the system? Positive; internal energy will decrease Positive; internal energy will increase Negative; internal energy will decrease Negative; internal energy will increase The First Law of Thermodynamics Teacher Support [BL] Review heat transfer. When and how does heat transfer energy between two bodies? What happens when energy is transferred into or out of a system by heat? Heat (Q) and work (W) are the two ways to add or remove energy from a system. The processes are very different. Heat is driven by temperature differences, while work involves a force exerted through a distance. Nevertheless, heat and work can produce identical results. For example, both can cause a temperature increase. Heat transfers energy into a system, such as when the sun warms the air in a bicycle tire and increases the air’s temperature. Similarly, work can be done on the system, as when the bicyclist pumps air into the tire. Once the temperature increase has occurred, it is impossible to tell whether it was caused by heat or work. Heat and work are both energy in transit—neither is stored as such in a system. However, both can change the internal energy, U, of a system. Internal energy is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of a system’s atoms and molecules. It can be divided into many subcategories, such as thermal and chemical energy, and depends only on the state of a system (that is, P, V, and T), not on how the energy enters or leaves the system. In order to understand the relationship between heat, work, and internal energy, we use the first law of thermodynamics. The first law of thermodynamics applies the conservation of energy principle to systems where heat and work are the methods of transferring energy into and out of the systems. It can also be used to describe how energy transferred by heat is converted and transferred again by work. Teacher Support [OL][AL] Ask students to give examples of processes where energy is converted from one form into another. Analyze whether energy transfer by heat occurs in each case. Recall that the principle of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can be altered from one form to another. The first law of thermodynamics states that the change in internal energy of a closed system equals the net heat transfer into the system minus the net work done by the system. In equation form, the first law of thermodynamics is ΔU=Q−W. Here, ΔU is the change in internal energy, U, of the system. As shown in , Q is the net heat transferred into the system—that is, Q is the sum of all heat transfers into and out of the system. W is the net work done by the system—that is, W is the sum of all work done on or by the system. By convention, if Q is positive, then there is a net heat transfer into the system; if W is positive, then there is net work done by the system. So positive Q adds energy to the system by heat, and positive W takes energy from the system by work. Note that if heat transfers more energy into the system than that which is done by work, the difference is stored as internal energy. The first law of thermodynamics is the conservation of energy principle stated for a system, where heat and work are the methods of transferring energy to and from a system. Q represents the net heat transfer—it is the sum of all transfers of energy by heat into and out of the system. Q is positive for net heat transfer into the system. W out is the work done by the system, and W in is the work done on the system. W is the total work done on or by the system. W is positive when more work is done by the system than on it. The change in the internal energy of the system, ΔU , is related to heat and work by the first law of thermodynamics: ΔU=Q−W. It follows also that negative Q indicates that energy is transferred away from the system by heat and so decreases the system’s internal energy, whereas negative W is work done on the system, which increases the internal energy. First Law of Thermodynamics/Internal Energy This video explains the first law of thermodynamics, conservation of energy, and internal energy. It goes over an example of energy transforming between kinetic energy, potential energy, and heat transfer due to air resistance. Teacher Support [BL][OL] Demonstrate that the equation may be rearranged as Q=ΔU+W. This shows that any energy added by heat to a system is either converted into work or stored as internal energy. More on Internal Energy This video goes into further detail, explaining internal energy and how to use the equation ΔU=Q−W. Note that Sal uses the equation ΔU=Q+W , where W is the work done on the system, whereas we use W to represent work done by the system. Biology: Biological Thermodynamics We often think about thermodynamics as being useful for inventing or testing machinery, such as engines or steam turbines. However, thermodynamics also applies to living systems, such as our own bodies. This forms the basis of the biological thermodynamics (). (a) The first law of thermodynamics applies to metabolism. Heat transferred out of the body (Q) and work done by the body (W) remove internal energy, whereas food intake replaces it. (Food intake may be considered work done on the body.) (b) Plants convert part of the radiant energy in sunlight into stored chemical energy, a process called photosynthesis. Life itself depends on the biological transfer of energy. Through photosynthesis, plants absorb solar energy from the sun and use this energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. Photosynthesis takes in one form of energy—light—and converts it into another form—chemical potential energy (glucose and other carbohydrates). Human metabolism is the conversion of food into energy given off by heat, work done by the body’s cells, and stored fat. Metabolism is an interesting example of the first law of thermodynamics in action. Eating increases the internal energy of the body by adding chemical potential energy; this is an unromantic view of a good burrito. The body metabolizes all the food we consume. Basically, metabolism is an oxidation process in which the chemical potential energy of food is released. This implies that food input is in the form of work. Exercise helps you lose weight, because it provides energy transfer from your body by both heat and work and raises your metabolic rate even when you are at rest. Biological thermodynamics also involves the study of transductions between cells and living organisms. Transduction is a process where genetic material—DNA—is transferred from one cell to another. This often occurs during a viral infection (e.g., influenza) and is how the virus spreads, namely, by transferring its genetic material to an increasing number of previously healthy cells. Once enough cells become infected, you begin to feel the effects of the virus (flu symptoms—muscle weakness, coughing, and congestion). Energy is transferred along with the genetic material and so obeys the first law of thermodynamics. Energy is transferred—not created or destroyed—in the process. When work is done on a cell or heat transfers energy to a cell, the cell’s internal energy increases. When a cell does work or loses heat, its internal energy decreases. If the amount of work done by a cell is the same as the amount of energy transferred in by heat, or the amount of work performed on a cell matches the amount of energy transferred out by heat, there will be no net change in internal energy. Based on what you know about heat transfer and the first law of thermodynamics, do you need to eat more or less to maintain a constant weight in colder weather? Explain why. more; as more energy is lost by the body in colder weather, the need to eat increases so as to maintain a constant weight more; eating more food means accumulating more fat, which will insulate the body from colder weather and will reduce the energy loss less; as less energy is lost by the body in colder weather, the need to eat decreases so as to maintain a constant weight less; eating less food means accumulating less fat, so less energy will be required to burn the fat, and, as a result, weight will remain constant Solving Problems Involving the First Law of Thermodynamics Calculating Change in Internal Energy Suppose 40.00 J of energy is transferred by heat to a system, while the system does 10.00 J of work. Later, heat transfers 25.00 J out of the system, while 4.00 J is done by work on the system. What is the net change in the system’s internal energy? Strategy You must first calculate the net heat and net work. Then, using the first law of thermodynamics, ΔU=Q−W, find the change in internal energy. Solution The net heat is the transfer into the system by heat minus the transfer out of the system by heat, or Q=40.00 J−25.00 J=15.00 J. The total work is the work done by the system minus the work done on the system, or W=10.00 J−4.00 J=6.00 J. The change in internal energy is given by the first law of thermodynamics. ΔU=Q−W=15.00 J−6.00 J=9.00 J Discussion A different way to solve this problem is to find the change in internal energy for each of the two steps separately and then add the two changes to get the total change in internal energy. This approach would look as follows: For 40.00 J of heat in and 10.00 J of work out, the change in internal energy is Δ U 1 = Q 1 − W 1 =40.00 J−10.00 J=30.00 J. For 25.00 J of heat out and 4.00 J of work in, the change in internal energy is Δ U 2 = Q 2 − W 2 =−25.00 J−(−4.00 J)=−21.00 J. The total change is ΔU=Δ U 1 +Δ U 2 =30.00 J+(−21.00 J)=9.00 J. No matter whether you look at the overall process or break it into steps, the change in internal energy is the same. Teacher Support [BL] Make sure students are clear on the use of negative signs for heat transfer and work. Work done by an isolated system means an increase in volume, so W is positive and ΔU decreases or is negative. Calculating Change in Internal Energy: The Same Change in U is Produced by Two Different Processes What is the change in the internal energy of a system when a total of 150.00 J is transferred by heat from the system and 159.00 J is done by work on the system? Strategy The net heat and work are already given, so simply use these values in the equation ΔU=Q−W. Solution Here, the net heat and total work are given directly as Q=−150.00 J and W=−159.00 J, so that ΔU=Q−W=−150.00 J−(−159.00 J)=9.00 J. Discussion Two different processes produce the same change in a system. (a) A total of 15.00 J of heat transfer occurs into the system, while work takes out a total of 6.00 J. The change in internal energy is ΔU = Q – W = 9.00 J. (b) Heat transfer removes 150.00 J from the system while work puts 159.00 J into it, producing an increase of 9.00 J in internal energy. If the system starts out in the same state in (a) and (b), it will end up in the same final state in either case—its final state is related to internal energy, not how that energy was acquired. A very different process in this second worked example produces the same 9.00 J change in internal energy as in the first worked example. Note that the change in the system in both parts is related to ΔU and not to the individual Q’s or W’s involved. The system ends up in the same state in both problems. Note that, as usual, in above, W out is work done by the system, and W in is work done on the system. Practice Problems Check Your Understanding Teacher Support Use these questions to assess student achievement of the section’s learning objectives. If students are struggling with a specific objective, these questions will help identify which and direct students to the relevant content. What is the SI unit for pressure? pascal, or N/m3 coulomb newton pascal, or N/m2 When is pressure-volume work said to be done ON a system? When there is an increase in both volume and internal pressure. When there is a decrease in both volume and internal pressure. When there is a decrease in volume and an increase in internal pressure. When there is an increase in volume and a decrease in internal pressure. Section Summary Pressure is the force per unit area over which the force is applied perpendicular to the area. Thermal expansion is the increase, or decrease, of the size (length, area, or volume) of a body due to a change in temperature. The ideal gas law relates the pressure and volume of a gas to the number of gas particles (atoms or molecules) and the absolute temperature of the gas. Heat and work are the two distinct methods of energy transfer. Heat is energy transferred solely due to a temperature difference. The first law of thermodynamics is given as ΔU=Q−W , where ΔU is the change in internal energy of a system, Q is the net energy transfer into the system by heat (the sum of all transfers by heat into and out of the system), and W is the net work done by the system (the sum of all energy transfers by work out of or into the system). Both Q and W represent energy in transit; only ΔU represents an independent quantity of energy capable of being stored. The internal energy U of a system depends only on the state of the system, and not how it reached that state. Key Equations ideal gas law PV=NkT first law of thermodynamics ΔU=Q−W pressure P= F A pressure–volume work W=PΔV Concept Items How does pressure-volume work relate to heat and internal energy of a system? The energy added to a system by heat minus the change in the internal energy of that system is equal to the pressure-volume work done by the system. The sum of the energy released by a system by heat and the change in the internal energy of that system is equal to the pressure-volume work done by the system. The product of the energy added to a system by heat and the change in the internal energy of that system is equal to the pressure-volume work done by the system. If the energy added to a system by heat is divided by the change in the internal energy of that system, the quotient is equal to the pressure-volume work done by the system. On what does internal energy depend?

In another tire, the temperature increase is due to exposure to the sun. Is it possible to tell what caused the temperature increase in each tire? Explain your answer. No, because it is a chemical change, and the cause of that change does not matter; the final state of both systems are the same. Although the final state of each system is identical, the source is different in each case. No, because the changes in energy for both systems are the same, and the cause of that change does not matter; the state of each system is identical. Yes, the changes in the energy for both systems are the same, but the causes of that change are different, so the states of each system are not identical. How does the transfer of energy from the sun help plants? Plants absorb solar energy from the sun and utilize it during the fertilization process. Plants absorb solar energy from the sun and utilize it during the process of photosynthesis to turn it into plant matter. Plants absorb solar energy from the sun and utilize it to increase the temperature inside them. Plants absorb solar energy from the sun and utilize it during the shedding of their leaves and fruits.

Temperature; inverse proportionality ( P∝ 1 T ) Temperature, direct proportionality to square root ( P∝ T ) Temperature; direct proportionality ( P∝ T ) Temperature; direct proportionality to square ( P∝ T 2 ) By convention, if Q is positive, what is the direction in which heat transfers energy with regard to the system? The direction of the heat transfer of energy depends on the changes in W, regardless of the sign of Q. The direction of Q cannot be determined from just the sign of Q. The direction of net heat transfer of energy will be out of the system. The direction of net heat transfer of energy will be into the system. Test Prep Extended Response Under which conditions will the work done by the gas in a system increase? It will increase when a large amount of energy is added to the system, and that energy causes an increase in the gass volume, its pressure, or both. It will increase when a large amount of energy is extracted from the system, and that energy causes an increase in the gass volume, its pressure, or both. It will increase when a large amount of energy is added to the system, and that energy causes a decrease in the gass volume, its pressure, or both.

How does energy transfer by heat aid in body metabolism? The energy is given to the body through the work done by the body (W) and through the intake of food, which may also be considered as the work done on the body. The transfer of energy out of the body is by heat (−Q) . The energy given to the body is by the intake of food, which may also be considered as the work done on the body. The transfer of energy out of the body is by heat (−Q) and the work done by the body (W) .

The student knows that changes occur within a physical system and applies the laws of conservation of energy and momentum. The student is expected to: (G) analyze and explain everyday examples that illustrate the laws of thermodynamics, including the law of conservation of energy and the law of entropy Section Key Terms entropy second law of thermodynamics Entropy Teacher Support [BL][OL][AL] Review heat and absolute temperature. Recall earlier discussions on engine efficiency. Assess students' understanding of efficiency. Recall from the chapter introduction that it is not even theoretically possible for engines to be 100 percent efficient. This phenomenon is explained by the second law of thermodynamics, which relies on a concept known as entropy. Entropy is a measure of the disorder of a system. Entropy also describes how much energy is not available to do work. The more disordered a system and higher the entropy, the less of a system's energy is available to do work. Teacher Support The meaning of entropy is difficult to grasp, as it may seem like an abstract concept. However, we see examples of entropy in our everyday lives. For instance, if a car tire is punctured, air disperses in all directions. When water in a dish is set on a counter, it eventually evaporates, the individual molecules spreading out in the surrounding air. When a hot object is placed in the room, it quickly spreads heat energy in all directions. Entropy can be thought of as a measure of the dispersal of energy. It measures how much energy has been dispersed in a process. The flow of any energy is always from high to low. Hence, entropy always tends to increase. Although all forms of energy can be used to do work, it is not possible to use the entire available energy for work. Consequently, not all energy transferred by heat can be converted into work, and some of it is lost in the form of waste heat—that is, heat that does not go toward doing work. The unavailability of energy is important in thermodynamics; in fact, the field originated from efforts to convert heat to work, as is done by engines. The equation for the change in entropy, ΔS , is ΔS= Q T , where Q is the heat that transfers energy during a process, and T is the absolute temperature at which the process takes place. Q is positive for energy transferred into the system by heat and negative for energy transferred out of the system by heat. In SI, entropy is expressed in units of joules per kelvin (J/K). If temperature changes during the process, then it is usually a good approximation (for small changes in temperature) to take T to be the average temperature in order to avoid trickier math (calculus). Absolute temperature is the temperature measured in Kelvins. The Kelvin scale is an absolute temperature scale that is measured in terms of the number of degrees above absolute zero. All temperatures are therefore positive. Using temperatures from another, nonabsolute scale, such as Fahrenheit or Celsius, will give the wrong answer. Second Law of ThermodynamicsHave you ever played the card game 52 pickup? If so, you have been on the receiving end of a practical joke and, in the process, learned a valuable lesson about the nature of the universe as described by the second law of thermodynamics. In the game of 52 pickup, the prankster tosses an entire deck of playing cards onto the floor, and you get to pick them up. In the process of picking up the cards, you may have noticed that the amount of work required to restore the cards to an orderly state in the deck is much greater than the amount of work required to toss the cards and create the disorder. The second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of a system either increases or remains constant in any spontaneous process; it never decreases. An important implication of this law is that heat transfers energy spontaneously from higher- to lower-temperature objects, but never spontaneously in the reverse direction. This is because entropy increases for heat transfer of energy from hot to cold (). Because the change in entropy is Q/T, there is a larger change in ΔS at lower temperatures (smaller T). The decrease in entropy of the hot (larger T) object is therefore less than the increase in entropy of the cold (smaller T) object, producing an overall increase in entropy for the system. The ice in this drink is slowly melting. Eventually, the components of the liquid will reach thermal equilibrium, as predicted by the second law of thermodynamics—that is, after heat transfers energy from the warmer liquid to the colder ice. (Jon Sullivan, PDPhoto.org) Another way of thinking about this is that it is impossible for any process to have, as its sole result, heat transferring energy from a cooler to a hotter object. Heat cannot transfer energy spontaneously from colder to hotter, because the entropy of the overall system would decrease. Suppose we mix equal masses of water that are originally at two different temperatures, say 20.0 °C and 40.0 °C . The result will be water at an intermediate temperature of 30.0 °C . Three outcomes have resulted: entropy has increased, some energy has become unavailable to do work, and the system has become less orderly. Let us think about each of these results. First, why has entropy increased? Mixing the two bodies of water has the same effect as the heat transfer of energy from the higher-temperature substance to the lower-temperature substance. The mixing decreases the entropy of the hotter water but increases the entropy of the colder water by a greater amount, producing an overall increase in entropy. Second, once the two masses of water are mixed, there is no more temperature difference left to drive energy transfer by heat and therefore to do work. The energy is still in the water, but it is now unavailable to do work. Third, the mixture is less orderly, or to use another term, less structured. Rather than having two masses at different temperatures and with different distributions of molecular speeds, we now have a single mass with a broad distribution of molecular speeds, the average of which yields an intermediate temperature. These three results—entropy, unavailability of energy, and disorder—not only are related but are, in fact, essentially equivalent. Heat transfer of energy from hot to cold is related to the tendency in nature for systems to become disordered and for less energy to be available for use as work. Based on this law, what cannot happen? A cold object in contact with a hot one never spontaneously transfers energy by heat to the hot object, getting colder while the hot object gets hotter. Nor does a hot, stationary automobile ever spontaneously cool off and start moving. Another example is the expansion of a puff of gas introduced into one corner of a vacuum chamber. The gas expands to fill the chamber, but it never regroups on its own in the corner. The random motion of the gas molecules could take them all back to the corner, but this is never observed to happen (). Examples of one-way processes in nature. (a) Heat transfer occurs spontaneously from hot to cold, but not from cold to hot. (b) The brakes of this car convert its kinetic energy to increase their internal energy (temperature), and heat transfers this energy to the environment. The reverse process is impossible. (c) The burst of gas released into this vacuum chamber quickly expands to uniformly fill every part of the chamber. The random motions of the gas molecules will prevent them from returning altogether to the corner. We've explained that heat never transfers energy spontaneously from a colder to a hotter object. The key word here is spontaneously. If we do work on a system, it is possible to transfer energy by heat from a colder to hotter object. We'll learn more about this in the next section, covering refrigerators as one of the applications of the laws of thermodynamics. Sometimes people misunderstand the second law of thermodynamics, thinking that based on this law, it is impossible for entropy to decrease at any particular location. But, it actually is possible for the entropy of one part of the universe to decrease, as long as the total change in entropy of the universe increases. In equation form, we can write this as Δ S tot =Δ S syst +Δ S envir >0 . Based on this equation, we see that Δ S syst can be negative as long as Δ S envir is positive and greater in magnitude. How is it possible for the entropy of a system to decrease? Energy transfer is necessary. If you pick up marbles that are scattered about the room and put them into a cup, your work has decreased the entropy of that system. If you gather iron ore from the ground and convert it into steel and build a bridge, your work has decreased the entropy of that system. Energy coming from the sun can decrease the entropy of local systems on Earth—that is, Δ S syst is negative. But the overall entropy of the rest of the universe increases by a greater amount—that is, Δ S envir is positive and greater in magnitude. In the case of the iron ore, although you made the system of the bridge and steel more structured, you did so at the expense of the universe. Altogether, the entropy of the universe is increased by the disorder created by digging up the ore and converting it to steel. Therefore, Δ S tot =Δ S syst +Δ S envir >0, and the second law of thermodynamics is not violated. Every time a plant stores some solar energy in the form of chemical potential energy, or an updraft of warm air lifts a soaring bird, Earth experiences local decreases in entropy as it uses part of the energy transfer from the sun into deep space to do work. There is a large total increase in entropy resulting from this massive energy transfer. A small part of this energy transfer by heat is stored in structured systems on Earth, resulting in much smaller, local decreases in entropy. Teacher Support [AL] Ask students what would happen if the second law of thermodynamics were not true. What if the direction of flow of energy were not predictable? Would life on Earth be able to function? Solving Problems Involving the Second Law of Thermodynamics Entropy is related not only to the unavailability of energy to do work; it is also a measure of disorder. For example, in the case of a melting block of ice, a highly structured and orderly system of water molecules changes into a disorderly liquid, in which molecules have no fixed positions (). There is a large increase in entropy for this process, as we'll see in the following worked example. These ice floes melt during the Arctic summer. Some of them refreeze in the winter, but the second law of thermodynamics predicts that it would be extremely unlikely for the water molecules contained in these particular floes to reform in the distinctive alligator-like shape they possessed when this picture was taken in the summer of 2009. (Patrick Kelley, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Geological Survey) Entropy Associated with Disorder Find the increase in entropy of 1.00 kg of ice that is originally at 0 °C and melts to form water at 0 °C . Strategy The change in entropy can be calculated from the definition of ΔS once we find the energy, Q, needed to melt the ice. Solution The change in entropy is defined as ΔS= Q T . Here, Q is the heat necessary to melt 1.00 kg of ice and is given by Q=m L f , where m is the mass and L f is the latent heat of fusion. L f =334 kJ/kg for water, so Q=(1.00 kg)(334 kJ/kg)=3.34× 10 5 J. Because Q is the amount of energy heat adds to the ice, its value is positive, and T is the melting temperature of ice, T=273 K So the change in entropy is ΔS= Q T = 3.34× 10 5 J 273 K =1.22× 10 3 J/K. Discussion When ice melts, it becomes more disordered and less structured. The systematic arrangement of molecules in a crystal structure is replaced by a more random and less orderly movement of molecules without fixed locations or orientations. Its entropy increases because heat transfer occurs into it. Entropy is a measure of disorder. The change in entropy is positive, because heat transfers energy into the ice to cause the phase change. This is a significant increase in entropy, because it takes place at a relatively low temperature. It is accompanied by an increase in the disorder of the water molecules.

If students are struggling with a specific objective, these questions will help identify which and direct students to the relevant content. What is entropy? Entropy is a measure of the potential energy of a system. Entropy is a measure of the net work done by a system. Entropy is a measure of the disorder of a system. Entropy is a measure of the heat transfer of energy into a system. Which forms of energy can be used to do work? Only work is able to do work. Only heat is able to do work. Only internal energy is able to do work. Heat, work, and internal energy are all able to do work. For heat transferring energy from a high to a low temperature, what usually happens to the entropy of the whole system? It decreases. It must remain constant. The entropy of the system cannot be predicted without specific values for the temperatures. It increases. Section Summary Entropy is a measure of a system's disorder: the greater the disorder, the larger the entropy. Entropy is also the reduced availability of energy to do work. The second law of thermodynamics states that, for any spontaneous process, the total entropy of a system either increases or remains constant; it never decreases. Heat transfers energy spontaneously from higher- to lower-temperature bodies, but never spontaneously in the reverse direction. Key Equations change in entropy ΔS= Q T Concept Items Air freshener is sprayed from a bottle. The molecules spread throughout the room and cannot make their way back into the bottle. Why is this the case? The entropy of the molecules increases. The entropy of the molecules decreases. The heat content (enthalpy, or total energy available for heat) of the molecules increases. The heat content (enthalpy, or total energy available for heat) of the molecules decreases.

It would be 0 percent. It would be less than 100 percent. It would be 100 percent. It would be greater than 100 percent. Entropy never decreases in a spontaneous process. Give an example to support this statement. The transfer of energy by heat from colder bodies to hotter bodies is a spontaneous process in which the entropy of the system of bodies increases. The melting of an ice cube placed in a room causes an increase in the entropy of the room. The dissolution of salt in water is a spontaneous process in which the entropy of the system increases. A plant uses energy from the sun and converts it into sugar molecules by the process of photosynthesis. Test Prep Multiple Choice Why does entropy increase during a spontaneous process?

Review the ideal gas law, laws of thermodynamics, and entropy. [OL] Ask students whether they can explain the limits on efficiency in terms of what they have now learned. Heat Engines, Heat Pumps, and RefrigeratorsIn this section, we’ll explore how heat engines, heat pumps, and refrigerators operate in terms of the laws of thermodynamics. One of the most important things we can do with heat is to use it to do work for us. A heat engine does exactly this—it makes use of the properties of thermodynamics to transform heat into work. Gasoline and diesel engines, jet engines, and steam turbines that generate electricity are all examples of heat engines. illustrates one of the ways in which heat transfers energy to do work. Fuel combustion releases chemical energy that heat transfers throughout the gas in a cylinder. This increases the gas temperature, which in turn increases the pressure of the gas and, therefore, the force it exerts on a movable piston. The gas does work on the outside world, as this force moves the piston through some distance. Thus, heat transfer of energy to the gas in the cylinder results in work being done. (a) Heat transfer to the gas in a cylinder increases the internal energy of the gas, creating higher pressure and temperature. (b) The force exerted on the movable cylinder does work as the gas expands. Gas pressure and temperature decrease during expansion, indicating that the gas’s internal energy has decreased as it does work. (c) Heat transfer of energy to the environment further reduces pressure in the gas, so that the piston can more easily return to its starting position. To repeat this process, the piston needs to be returned to its starting point. Heat now transfers energy from the gas to the surroundings, so that the gas’s pressure decreases, and a force is exerted by the surroundings to push the piston back through some distance. A cyclical process brings a system, such as the gas in a cylinder, back to its original state at the end of every cycle. All heat engines use cyclical processes. Heat engines do work by using part of the energy transferred by heat from some source. As shown in , heat transfers energy, Q h , from the high-temperature object (or hot reservoir), whereas heat transfers unused energy, Q c , into the low-temperature object (or cold reservoir), and the work done by the engine is W. In physics, a reservoir is defined as an infinitely large mass that can take in or put out an unlimited amount of heat, depending upon the needs of the system. The temperature of the hot reservoir is T h , and the temperature of the cold reservoir is T c . (a) Heat transfers energy spontaneously from a hot object to a cold one, as is consistent with the second law of thermodynamics. (b) A heat engine, represented here by a circle, uses part of the energy transferred by heat to do work. The hot and cold objects are called the hot and cold reservoirs. Qh is the heat out of the hot reservoir, W is the work output, and Qc is the unused heat into the cold reservoir. As noted, a cyclical process brings the system back to its original condition at the end of every cycle. Such a system’s internal energy, U, is the same at the beginning and end of every cycle—that is, ΔU=0 . The first law of thermodynamics states that ΔU=Q−W , where Q is the net heat transfer during the cycle, and W is the net work done by the system. The net heat transfer is the energy transferred in by heat from the hot reservoir minus the amount that is transferred out to the cold reservoir ( Q= Q h − Q c ). Because there is no change in internal energy for a complete cycle ( ΔU=0 ), we have 0=Q−W, so that W=Q . Therefore, the net work done by the system equals the net heat into the system, or W= Q h − Q c for a cyclical process. Because the hot reservoir is heated externally, which is an energy-intensive process, it is important that the work be done as efficiently as possible. In fact, we want W to equal Q h , and for there to be no heat to the environment (that is, Q c =0 ). Unfortunately, this is impossible. According to the second law of thermodynamics, heat engines cannot have perfect conversion of heat into work. Recall that entropy is a measure of the disorder of a system, which is also how much energy is unavailable to do work. The second law of thermodynamics requires that the total entropy of a system either increases or remains constant in any process. Therefore, there is a minimum amount of Q h that cannot be used for work. The amount of heat rejected to the cold reservoir, Q c , depends upon the efficiency of the heat engine. The smaller the increase in entropy, ΔS , the smaller the value of Q c , and the more heat energy is available to do work.Heat pumps, air conditioners, and refrigerators utilize heat transfer of energy from low to high temperatures, which is the opposite of what heat engines do. Heat transfers energy Q c from a cold reservoir and delivers energy Q h into a hot one. This requires work input, W, which produces a transfer of energy by heat. Therefore, the total heat transfer to the hot reservoir is Q h = Q c +W. The purpose of a heat pump is to transfer energy by heat to a warm environment, such as a home in the winter. The great advantage of using a heat pump to keep your home warm rather than just burning fuel in a fireplace or furnace is that a heat pump supplies Q h = Q c +W . Heat Q c comes from the outside air, even at a temperature below freezing, to the indoor space. You only pay for W, and you get an additional heat transfer of Q c from the outside at no cost. In many cases, at least twice as much energy is transferred to the heated space as is used to run the heat pump. When you burn fuel to keep warm, you pay for all of it. The disadvantage to a heat pump is that the work input (required by the second law of thermodynamics) is sometimes more expensive than simply burning fuel, especially if the work is provided by electrical energy. The basic components of a heat pump are shown in . A working fluid, such as a refrigerant, is used. In the outdoor coils (the evaporator), heat Q c enters the working fluid from the cold outdoor air, turning it into a gas. A simple heat pump has four basic components: (1) an evaporator, (2) a compressor, (3) a condenser, and (4) an expansion valve. In the heating mode, heat transfers Q c to the working fluid in the evaporator (1) from the colder, outdoor air, turning it into a gas. The electrically driven compressor (2) increases the temperature and pressure of the gas and forces it into the condenser coils (3) inside the heated space. Because the temperature of the gas is higher than the temperature in the room, heat transfers energy from the gas to the room as the gas condenses into a liquid. The working fluid is then cooled as it flows back through an expansion valve (4) to the outdoor evaporator coils. The electrically driven compressor (work input W) raises the temperature and pressure of the gas and forces it into the condenser coils that are inside the heated space. Because the temperature of the gas is higher than the temperature inside the room, heat transfers energy to the room, and the gas condenses into a liquid. The liquid then flows back through an expansion (pressure-reducing) valve. The liquid, having been cooled through expansion, returns to the outdoor evaporator coils to resume the cycle. The quality of a heat pump is judged by how much energy is transferred by heat into the warm space ( Q h ) compared with how much input work (W) is required. Teacher Support Remember that refrigerators and air conditioners do not create cold. They merely transfer heat from the inside to the outside.Revisit the ideal gas law, laws of thermodynamics, and entropy. Use these to understand the workings of air conditioners and refrigerators. This will also give you the opportunity to assess your understanding of these concepts. Both refrigerators and air conditioners use chemicals that can easily change phase from liquid to gas and back. The chemical is present in a closed circuit of tubing. Initially, it is in a gaseous state. The compressor works to squeeze the gas particles of the chemical closer together, creating high pressure. Following the ideal gas law, as pressure increases, so does temperature. This hot, dense gas spreads out in the small pipes or fins of the condenser, which is located on the outside part of the air conditioner (and backside of a refrigerator). The fins come in contact with outside air, which is cooler than the compressed chemical, and hence, as entropy indicates, heat transfers energy from the hot condenser to the relatively cooler air. The result is that the gas cools and condenses into a liquid. This liquid is then allowed to go to an evaporator through a tiny, narrow hole. On the other side of the hole, the gas spreads out (entropy increases), and its pressure drops. Consequently, obeying the ideal gas law, its temperature decreases as well. A fan blows air over this now-cool evaporator and into the room or refrigerator (). Heat pumps, air conditioners, and refrigerators are heat engines operated backward. Almost every home contains a refrigerator. Most people don’t realize that they are also sharing their homes with a heat pump. Air conditioners and refrigerators are designed to cool substances by transferring energy by heat Q c out of a cool environment to a warmer one, where heat Q h is given up. In the case of a refrigerator, heat is moved out of the inside of the fridge into the surrounding room. For an air conditioner, heat is transferred outdoors from inside a home. Heat pumps are also often used in a reverse setting to cool rooms in the summer. As with heat pumps, work input is required for heat transfer of energy from cold to hot. The quality of air conditioners and refrigerators is judged by how much energy is removed by heat Q c from a cold environment, compared with how much work, W, is required. So, what is considered the energy benefit in a heat pump, is considered waste heat in a refrigerator. Thermal Efficiency In the conversion of energy into work, we are always faced with the problem of getting less out than we put in. The problem is that, in all processes, there is some heat Q c that transfers energy to the environment—and usually a very significant amount at that. A way to quantify how efficiently a machine runs is through a quantity called thermal efficiency. We define thermal efficiency, Eff, to be the ratio of useful energy output to the energy input (or, in other words, the ratio of what we get to what we spend). The efficiency of a heat engine is the output of net work, W, divided by heat-transferred energy, Q h , into the engine; that is Eff= W Q h . An efficiency of 1, or 100 percent, would be possible only if there were no heat to the environment ( Q c =0 ). All values of heat ( Q h and Q c ) are positive; there is no such thing as negative heat. The direction of heat is indicated by a plus or minus sign. For example, Q c is out of the system, so it is preceded by a minus sign in the equation for net heat. Q= Q h − Q c Solving Thermal Efficiency Problems Daily Work Done by a Coal-Fired Power Station and Its Efficiency A coal-fired power station is a huge heat engine. It uses heat to transfer energy from burning coal to do work to turn turbines, which are used then to generate electricity. In a single day, a large coal power station transfers 2.50× 10 14 J by heat from burning coal and transfers 1.48× 10 14 J by heat into the environment. (a) What is the work done by the power station? (b) What is the efficiency of the power station? Strategy We can use W= Q h − Q c to find the work output, W, assuming a cyclical process is used in the power station. In this process, water is boiled under pressure to form high-temperature steam, which is used to run steam turbine-generators and then condensed back to water to start the cycle again. Solution Work output is given by W= Q h − Q c . Substituting the given values, W=2.50× 10 14 J−1.48× 10 14 J=1.02× 10 14 J. Strategy The efficiency can be calculated with Eff= W Q h , because Q h is given, and work, W, was calculated in the first part of this example. Solution Efficiency is given by Eff= W Q h . The work, W, is found to be 1.02× 10 14 J , and Q h is given ( 2.50× 10 14 J ), so the efficiency is Eff= 1.02× 10 14 J 2.50× 10 14 J =0.408, or 40.8%. Discussion The efficiency found is close to the usual value of 42 percent for coal-burning power stations. It means that fully 59.2 percent of the energy is transferred by heat to the environment, which usually results in warming lakes, rivers, or the ocean near the power station and is implicated in a warming planet generally. While the laws of thermodynamics limit the efficiency of such plants—including plants fired by nuclear fuel, oil, and natural gas—the energy transferred by heat to the environment could be, and sometimes is, used for heating homes or for industrial processes. Practice Problems A heat engine takes in 6.0 kJ from heat and produces waste heat of 4.8 kJ.

If students are struggling with a specific objective, these questions will help identify which and direct students to the relevant content. Give an example of a heat engine. A generator A battery A water pump A car engine Section Summary Heat engines use the heat transfer of energy to do work. Cyclical processes are processes that return to their original state at the end of every cycle. The thermal efficiency of a heat engine is the ratio of work output divided by the amount of energy input. The amount of work a heat engine can do is determined by the net heat transfer of energy during a cycle; more waste heat leads to less work output. Heat pumps draw energy by heat from cold outside air and use it to heat an interior room. A refrigerator is a type of heat pump; it takes energy from the warm air from the inside compartment and transfers it to warmer exterior air. Key Equations thermal efficiency of a heat engine Eff= W Q h work output for a cyclical process W= Q h − Q c Concept Items What is the quality by which air conditioners are judged?

Some energy is always gained by heat from the environment. Some energy is always lost by heat to the environment. Work output is always greater than energy input. Work output is infinite for any energy input. What is a cyclic process? A process in which the system returns to its original state at the end of the cycle A process in which the system does not return to its original state at the end of the cycle A process in which the system follows the same path for every cycle A process in which the system follows a different path for every cycle Critical Thinking What is the advantage of a heat pump as opposed to burning fuel (as in a fireplace) for keeping warm? A heat pump supplies energy by heat from the cold, outside air. A heat pump supplies energy generated by the work done. A heat pump supplies energy by heat from the cold, outside air and also from the energy generated by the work done. A heat pump supplies energy not by heat from the cold, outside air, nor from the energy generated by the work done, but from more accessible sources. What is thermal efficiency of an engine? Can it ever be 100 percent? Why or why not? Thermal efficiency is the ratio of the output (work) to the input (heat). It is always 100 percent. Thermal efficiency is the ratio of the output (heat) to the input (work). It is always 100 percent. Thermal efficiency is the ratio of the output (heat) to the input (work). It is never 100 percent. Thermal efficiency is the ratio of the output (work) to the input (heat). It is never 100 percent. When would 100 percent thermal efficiency be possible? When all energy is transferred by heat to the environment When mass transferred to the environment is zero When mass transferred to the environment is at a maximum When no energy is transferred by heat to the environment Problems A coal power station functions at 40.0 percent efficiency.

ΔU W Qh Qc Which of the following always has the greatest value in a system having 80 percent thermal efficiency? ΔU W Qh Qc In the equation Q = Qh − Qc, what does the negative sign indicate? Heat transfer of energy is always negative. Heat transfer can only occur in one direction. Heat is directed into the system from the surroundings outside the system. Heat is directed out of the system. What is the purpose of a heat pump? A heat pump uses work to transfer energy by heat from a colder environment to a warmer environment. A heat pump uses work to transfer energy by heat from a warmer environment to a colder environment.

There are four materials available for you to test, each of which will find use under different sets of conditions and temperature ranges: Materials Four sample materials with similar mass or volume: copper, steel, water, and alcohol (ethanol or isopropanol) Oven or similar heating source Instrument (e.g., meter ruler, Vernier calipers, or micrometer) for measuring changes in dimension Balance for measuring mass Procedure Design a safe experiment to analyze the thermal expansion properties of each material. Write down the materials needed for your experiment and the procedure you will follow. Make sure that you include every detail so that the experiment can be repeated by others. Select an appropriate material to measure temperature over a predecided temperature range, and give reasons for your choice. Calibrate your instrument to measure temperature changes accurately. Which physical quantities are affected by temperature change and thermal expansion? How do such properties as specific heat and thermal conductivity affect the use of each material as a thermometer? Does a change of phase take place for any of the tested materials over the temperature range to be examined? What are your independent and dependent variables for this series of tests? Which variables need to be controlled in the experiment? What are your sources of error? Can all the tested materials be used effectively in the same ranges of temperature? Which applications might be suitable for one or more of the tested substances but not the others? Teacher Support This performance task supports the following: NGSS HS-PS3-3: Design, build, and refine a device that works within given constraints to convert one form of energy into another form of energy. Alcohol and water can be used effectively in a temperature range between 0 °C and 100 °C. Copper and steel do not expand greatly at these temperatures. The experimental design needs to take this into account. During thermal expansion, the entire volume of the substance changes, with proportional expansion or contraction occurring in each dimension. Student designs should take this into account; if possible, students should design a means by which all but one dimension is constrained so that temperature may be related directly to linear change (i.e., expansion or contraction in one dimension only). Test Prep Extended Response In the equation W = Qh − Qc, if the value of Qc were equal to zero, what would it signify? The efficiency of the engine is 75 percent. The efficiency of the engine is 25 percent. The efficiency of the engine is 0 percent. The efficiency of the engine is 100 percent.

The student knows the characteristics and behavior of waves. The student is expected to: (A) examine and describe oscillatory motion and wave propagation in various types of media. Section Key Terms longitudinal wave mechanical wave medium wave periodic wave pulse wave transverse wave Mechanical Waves What do we mean when we say something is a wave? A wave is a disturbance that travels or propagates from the place where it was created. Waves transfer energy from one place to another, but they do not necessarily transfer any mass. Light, sound, and waves in the ocean are common examples of waves. Sound and water waves are mechanical waves; meaning, they require a medium to travel through. The medium may be a solid, a liquid, or a gas, and the speed of the wave depends on the material properties of the medium through which it is traveling. However, light is not a mechanical wave; it can travel through a vacuum such as the empty parts of outer space. A familiar wave that you can easily imagine is the water wave. For water waves, the disturbance is in the surface of the water, an example of which is the disturbance created by a rock thrown into a pond or by a swimmer splashing the water surface repeatedly. For sound waves, the disturbance is caused by a change in air pressure, an example of which is when the oscillating cone inside a speaker creates a disturbance. For earthquakes, there are several types of disturbances, which include the disturbance of Earth’s surface itself and the pressure disturbances under the surface. Even radio waves are most easily understood using an analogy with water waves. Because water waves are common and visible, visualizing water waves may help you in studying other types of waves, especially those that are not visible. Water waves have characteristics common to all waves, such as amplitude, period, frequency, and energy, which we will discuss in the next section. Teacher Support Many people think that water waves push water from one direction to another. In reality, however, the particles of water tend to stay in one location only, except for moving up and down due to the energy in the wave. The energy moves forward through the water, but the water particles stay in one place. If you feel yourself being pushed in an ocean, what you feel is the energy of the wave, not the rush of water. If you put a cork in water that has waves, you will see that the water mostly moves it up and down. [BL][OL][AL] Ask students to give examples of mechanical and nonmechanical waves. Pulse Waves and Periodic Waves If you drop a pebble into the water, only a few waves may be generated before the disturbance dies down, whereas in a wave pool, the waves are continuous. A pulse wave is a sudden disturbance in which only one wave or a few waves are generated, such as in the example of the pebble. Thunder and explosions also create pulse waves. A periodic wave repeats the same oscillation for several cycles, such as in the case of the wave pool, and is associated with simple harmonic motion. Each particle in the medium experiences simple harmonic motion in periodic waves by moving back and forth periodically through the same positions. Teacher Support [BL] Any kind of wave, whether mechanical or nonmechanical, or transverse or longitudinal, can be in the form of a pulse wave or a periodic wave. Consider the simplified water wave in . This wave is an up-and-down disturbance of the water surface, characterized by a sine wave pattern. The uppermost position is called the crest and the lowest is the trough. It causes a seagull to move up and down in simple harmonic motion as the wave crests and troughs pass under the bird. An idealized ocean wave passes under a seagull that bobs up and down in simple harmonic motion. Longitudinal Waves and Transverse Waves Mechanical waves are categorized by their type of motion and fall into any of two categories: transverse or longitudinal. Note that both transverse and longitudinal waves can be periodic. A transverse wave propagates so that the disturbance is perpendicular to the direction of propagation. An example of a transverse wave is shown in , where a woman moves a toy spring up and down, generating waves that propagate away from herself in the horizontal direction while disturbing the toy spring in the vertical direction. In this example of a transverse wave, the wave propagates horizontally and the disturbance in the toy spring is in the vertical direction. In contrast, in a longitudinal wave, the disturbance is parallel to the direction of propagation. shows an example of a longitudinal wave, where the woman now creates a disturbance in the horizontal direction—which is the same direction as the wave propagation—by stretching and then compressing the toy spring. In this example of a longitudinal wave, the wave propagates horizontally and the disturbance in the toy spring is also in the horizontal direction. Longitudinal waves are sometimes called compression waves or compressional waves, and transverse waves are sometimes called shear waves. Teacher Support Transverse and longitudinal waves may be demonstrated in the class using a spring or a toy spring, as shown in the figures. Waves may be transverse, longitudinal, or a combination of the two. The waves on the strings of musical instruments are transverse (as shown in ), and so are electromagnetic waves, such as visible light. Sound waves in air and water are longitudinal. Their disturbances are periodic variations in pressure that are transmitted in fluids. The wave on a guitar string is transverse. However, the sound wave coming out of a speaker rattles a sheet of paper in a direction that shows that such sound wave is longitudinal. Sound in solids can be both longitudinal and transverse. Essentially, water waves are also a combination of transverse and longitudinal components, although the simplified water wave illustrated in does not show the longitudinal motion of the bird. Earthquake waves under Earth’s surface have both longitudinal and transverse components as well. The longitudinal waves in an earthquake are called pressure or P-waves, and the transverse waves are called shear or S-waves. These components have important individual characteristics; for example, they propagate at different speeds. Earthquakes also have surface waves that are similar to surface waves on water. Teacher Support Energy propagates differently in transverse and longitudinal waves. It is important to know the type of the wave in which energy is propagating to understand how it may affect the materials around it. Introduction to Waves This video explains wave propagation in terms of momentum using an example of a wave moving along a rope. It also covers the differences between transverse and longitudinal waves, and between pulse and periodic waves. The Physics of Surfing Many people enjoy surfing in the ocean. For some surfers, the bigger the wave, the better. In one area off the coast of central California, waves can reach heights of up to 50 feet in certain times of the year (). A surfer negotiates a steep take-off on a winter day in California while his friend watches. (Ljsurf, Wikimedia Commons) How do waves reach such extreme heights? Other than unusual causes, such as when earthquakes produce tsunami waves, most huge waves are caused simply by interactions between the wind and the surface of the water. The wind pushes up against the surface of the water and transfers energy to the water in the process. The stronger the wind, the more energy transferred. As waves start to form, a larger surface area becomes in contact with the wind, and even more energy is transferred from the wind to the water, thus creating higher waves. Intense storms create the fastest winds, kicking up massive waves that travel out from the origin of the storm. Longer-lasting storms and those storms that affect a larger area of the ocean create the biggest waves since they transfer more energy. The cycle of the tides from the Moon’s gravitational pull also plays a small role in creating waves. Actual ocean waves are more complicated than the idealized model of the simple transverse wave with a perfect sinusoidal shape. Ocean waves are examples of orbital progressive waves, where water particles at the surface follow a circular path from the crest to the trough of the passing wave, then cycle back again to their original position. This cycle repeats with each passing wave. As waves reach shore, the water depth decreases and the energy of the wave is compressed into a smaller volume. This creates higher waves—an effect known as shoaling. Since the water particles along the surface move from the crest to the trough, surfers hitch a ride on the cascading water, gliding along the surface. If ocean waves work exactly like the idealized transverse waves, surfing would be much less exciting as it would simply involve standing on a board that bobs up and down in place, just like the seagull in the previous figure.Additional information and illustrations about the scientific principles behind surfing can be found in the “Using Science to Surf Better!” video.

Mechanical waves must travel through a medium. Sound waves, water waves, and earthquake waves are all examples of mechanical waves. Light is not a mechanical wave since it can travel through a vacuum. A periodic wave is a wave that repeats for several cycles, whereas a pulse wave has only one crest or a few crests and is associated with a sudden disturbance. Periodic waves are associated with simple harmonic motion. A transverse wave has a disturbance perpendicular to its direction of propagation, whereas a longitudinal wave has a disturbance parallel to its direction of propagation.

However, it is helpful to word the definitions in a more specific way that applies directly to waves: Amplitude—distance between the resting position and the maximum displacement of the wave Frequency—number of waves passing by a specific point per second Period—time it takes for one wave cycle to complete In addition to amplitude, frequency, and period, their wavelength and wave velocity also characterize waves. The wavelength λ is the distance between adjacent identical parts of a wave, parallel to the direction of propagation. The wave velocity v w is the speed at which the disturbance moves. Wave velocity is sometimes also called the propagation velocity or propagation speed because the disturbance propagates from one location to another. Consider the periodic water wave in . Its wavelength is the distance from crest to crest or from trough to trough. The wavelength can also be thought of as the distance a wave has traveled after one complete cycle—or one period. The time for one complete up-and-down motion is the simple water wave’s period T. In the figure, the wave itself moves to the right with a wave velocity vw. Its amplitude X is the distance between the resting position and the maximum displacement—either the crest or the trough—of the wave. It is important to note that this movement of the wave is actually the disturbance moving to the right, not the water itself; otherwise, the bird would move to the right. Instead, the seagull bobs up and down in place as waves pass underneath, traveling a total distance of 2X in one cycle. However, as mentioned in the text feature on surfing, actual ocean waves are more complex than this simplified example. The wave has a wavelength λ, which is the distance between adjacent identical parts of the wave. The up-and-down disturbance of the surface propagates parallel to the surface at a speed vw. Amplitude, Period, Frequency, and Wavelength of Periodic Waves This video is a continuation of the video “Introduction to Waves” from the \"Types of Waves\" section. It discusses the properties of a periodic wave: amplitude, period, frequency, wavelength, and wave velocity. The crest of a wave is sometimes also called the peak. The Relationship between Wave Frequency, Period, Wavelength, and VelocitySince wave frequency is the number of waves per second, and the period is essentially the number of seconds per wave, the relationship between frequency and period is f= 1 T or T= 1 f , just as in the case of harmonic motion of an object. We can see from this relationship that a higher frequency means a shorter period. Recall that the unit for frequency is hertz (Hz), and that 1 Hz is one cycle—or one wave—per second. The speed of propagation vw is the distance the wave travels in a given time, which is one wavelength in a time of one period. In equation form, it is written as v w = λ T or v w =fλ . From this relationship, we see that in a medium where vw is constant, the higher the frequency, the smaller the wavelength. See . Because they travel at the same speed in a given medium, low-frequency sounds must have a greater wavelength than high-frequency sounds. Here, the lower-frequency sounds are emitted by the large speaker, called a woofer, while the higher-frequency sounds are emitted by the small speaker, called a tweeter. Teacher Support [BL] For sound, a higher frequency corresponds to a higher pitch while a lower frequency corresponds to a lower pitch. Amplitude corresponds to the loudness of the sound. [BL][OL] Since sound at all frequencies has the same speed in air, a change in frequency means a change in wavelength. [Figure Support] The same speaker is capable of reproducing both high- and low-frequency sounds. However, high frequencies have shorter wavelengths and are hence best reproduced by a speaker with a small, hard, and tight cone (tweeter), whereas lower frequencies are best reproduced by a large and soft cone (woofer). These fundamental relationships hold true for all types of waves. As an example, for water waves, vw is the speed of a surface wave; for sound, vw is the speed of sound; and for visible light, vw is the speed of light. The amplitude X is completely independent of the speed of propagation vw and depends only on the amount of energy in the wave. Waves in a Bowl In this lab, you will take measurements to determine how the amplitude and the period of waves are affected by the transfer of energy from a cork dropped into the water. The cork initially has some potential energy when it is held above the water—the greater the height, the higher the potential energy. When it is dropped, such potential energy is converted to kinetic energy as the cork falls. When the cork hits the water, that energy travels through the water in waves. Large bowl or basin Water Cork (or ping pong ball) Stopwatch Measuring tape Instructions ProcedureFill a large bowl or basin with water and wait for the water to settle so there are no ripples. Gently drop a cork into the middle of the bowl. Estimate the wavelength and the period of oscillation of the water wave that propagates away from the cork. You can estimate the period by counting the number of ripples from the center to the edge of the bowl while your partner times it. This information, combined with the bowl measurement, will give you the wavelength when the correct formula is used. Remove the cork from the bowl and wait for the water to settle again. Gently drop the cork at a height that is different from the first drop. Repeat Steps 3 to 5 to collect a second and third set of data, dropping the cork from different heights and recording the resulting wavelengths and periods. Interpret your results. Teacher Support Students can measure the bowl beforehand to help them make a better estimation of the wavelength. Geology: Physics of Seismic Waves The destructive effect of an earthquake is a palpable evidence of the energy carried in the earthquake waves. The Richter scale rating of earthquakes is related to both their amplitude and the energy they carry. (Petty Officer 2nd Class Candice Villarreal, U.S. Navy) Geologists rely heavily on physics to study earthquakes since earthquakes involve several types of wave disturbances, including disturbance of Earth’s surface and pressure disturbances under the surface. Surface earthquake waves are similar to surface waves on water. The waves under Earth’s surface have both longitudinal and transverse components. The longitudinal waves in an earthquake are called pressure waves (P-waves) and the transverse waves are called shear waves (S-waves). These two types of waves propagate at different speeds, and the speed at which they travel depends on the rigidity of the medium through which they are traveling. During earthquakes, the speed of P-waves in granite is significantly higher than the speed of S-waves. Both components of earthquakes travel more slowly in less rigid materials, such as sediments. P-waves have speeds of 4 to 7 km/s, and S-waves have speeds of 2 to 5 km/s, but both are faster in more rigid materials. The P-wave gets progressively farther ahead of the S-wave as they travel through Earth’s crust. For that reason, the time difference between the P- and S-waves is used to determine the distance to their source, the epicenter of the earthquake. We know from seismic waves produced by earthquakes that parts of the interior of Earth are liquid. Shear or transverse waves cannot travel through a liquid and are not transmitted through Earth’s core. In contrast, compression or longitudinal waves can pass through a liquid and they do go through the core. All waves carry energy, and the energy of earthquake waves is easy to observe based on the amount of damage left behind after the ground has stopped moving. Earthquakes can shake whole cities to the ground, performing the work of thousands of wrecking balls. The amount of energy in a wave is related to its amplitude. Large-amplitude earthquakes produce large ground displacements and greater damage. As earthquake waves spread out, their amplitude decreases, so there is less damage the farther they get from the source. What is the relationship between the propagation speed, frequency, and wavelength of the S-waves in an earthquake? The relationship between the propagation speed, frequency, and wavelength is v w =fλ. The relationship between the propagation speed, frequency, and wavelength is v w = f λ . The relationship between the propagation speed, frequency, and wavelength is v w = λ f . The relationship between the propagation speed, frequency, and wavelength is v w = fλ . Wave on a String In this animation, watch how a string vibrates in slow motion by choosing the Slow Motion setting. Select the No End and Manual options, and wiggle the end of the string to make waves yourself. Then switch to the Oscillate setting to generate waves automatically. Adjust the frequency and the amplitude of the oscillations to see what happens. Then experiment with adjusting the damping and the tension. Which of the settingsamplitude, frequency, damping, or tensionchanges the amplitude of the wave as it propagates? What does it do to the amplitude? Frequency; it decreases the amplitude of the wave as it propagates. Frequency; it increases the amplitude of the wave as it propagates. Damping; it decreases the amplitude of the wave as it propagates. Damping; it increases the amplitude of the wave as it propagates. Solving Wave Problems Calculate the Velocity of Wave Propagation: Gull in the Ocean Calculate the wave velocity of the ocean wave in the previous figure if the distance between wave crests is 10.0 m and the time for a seagull to bob up and down is 5.00 s. Strategy The values for the wavelength (λ=10.0 m) and the period ( T=5.00s) are given and we are asked to find v w Therefore, we can use v w = λ T to find the wave velocity. Solution Enter the known values into v w = λ T v w = 10.0 m 5.00 s =2.00 m/s. Discussion This slow speed seems reasonable for an ocean wave. Note that in the figure, the wave moves to the right at this speed, which is different from the varying speed at which the seagull bobs up and down. Calculate the Period and the Wave Velocity of a Toy Spring The woman in creates two waves every second by shaking the toy spring up and down. (a)What is the period of each wave? (b) If each wave travels 0.9 meters after one complete wave cycle, what is the velocity of wave propagation? Strategy FOR (A) To find the period, we solve for T= 1 f , given the value of the frequency ( f=2 s −1 ). Solution for (a) Enter the known value into T= 1 f T= 1 2 s −1 =0.5 s. Strategy FOR (B) Since one definition of wavelength is the distance a wave has traveled after one complete cycle—or one period—the values for the wavelength (λ=0.9 m) as well as the frequency are given. Therefore, we can use v w =fλ to find the wave velocity. Solution for (b) Enter the known values into v w =fλ v w =fλ=(2 s −1 )(0.9 m) = 1.8 m/s. Discussion We could have also used the equation v w = λ T to solve for the wave velocity since we already know the value of the period ( T=0.5s) from our calculation in part (a), and we would come up with the same answer.

A wave has a wavelength λ , which is the distance between adjacent identical parts of the wave. The wave velocity and the wavelength are related to the wave’s frequency and period by v w = λ T or v w =fλ . The time for one complete wave cycle is the period T.

Section Key Terms antinode constructive interference destructive interference inversion nodes reflection refraction standing wave superposition Teacher Support [BL][OL] Review waves, their types, and their properties, as covered in the previous sections. Superposition of Waves Most waves do not look very simple. They look more like the waves in , rather than the simple water wave considered in the previous sections, which has a perfect sinusoidal shape. These waves result from the superposition of several waves from different sources, producing a complex pattern. (Waterborough, Wikimedia Commons) Teacher Support The horizontal waves in the picture bounce off the wall of the lake seen in the front part of the picture. These superimpose or combine with waves moving in a different direction. When they combine, their energies get added, forming higher peaks and lower crests in specific places. This is why the water has a crisscross pattern. Most waves appear complex because they result from two or more simple waves that combine as they come together at the same place at the same time—a phenomenon called superposition. Waves superimpose by adding their disturbances; each disturbance corresponds to a force, and all the forces add. If the disturbances are along the same line, then the resulting wave is a simple addition of the disturbances of the individual waves, that is, their amplitudes add. Wave InterferenceThe two special cases of superposition that produce the simplest results are pure constructive interference and pure destructive interference. Pure constructive interference occurs when two identical waves arrive at the same point exactly in phase. When waves are exactly in phase, the crests of the two waves are precisely aligned, as are the troughs. Refer to . Because the disturbances add, the pure constructive interference of two waves with the same amplitude produces a wave that has twice the amplitude of the two individual waves, but has the same wavelength. The pure constructive interference of two identical waves produces a wave with twice the amplitude but the same wavelength. shows two identical waves that arrive exactly out of phase—that is, precisely aligned crest to trough—producing pure destructive interference. Because the disturbances are in opposite directions for this superposition, the resulting amplitude is zero for pure destructive interference; that is, the waves completely cancel out each other. The pure destructive interference of two identical waves produces zero amplitude, or complete cancellation. While pure constructive interference and pure destructive interference can occur, they are not very common because they require precisely aligned identical waves. The superposition of most waves that we see in nature produces a combination of constructive and destructive interferences. Waves that are not results of pure constructive or destructive interference can vary from place to place and time to time. The sound from a stereo, for example, can be loud in one spot and soft in another. The varying loudness means that the sound waves add partially constructively and partially destructively at different locations. A stereo has at least two speakers that create sound waves, and waves can reflect from walls. All these waves superimpose. An example of sounds that vary over time from constructive to destructive is found in the combined whine of jet engines heard by a stationary passenger. The volume of the combined sound can fluctuate up and down as the sound from the two engines varies in time from constructive to destructive. The two previous examples considered waves that are similar—both stereo speakers generate sound waves with the same amplitude and wavelength, as do the jet engines. But what happens when two waves that are not similar, that is, having different amplitudes and wavelengths, are superimposed? An example of the superposition of two dissimilar waves is shown in . Here again, the disturbances add and subtract, but they produce an even more complicated-looking wave. The resultant wave from the combined disturbances of two dissimilar waves looks much different than the idealized sinusoidal shape of a periodic wave. The superposition of nonidentical waves exhibits both constructive and destructive interferences. Wave Interference In this simulation, make waves with a dripping faucet, an audio speaker, or a laser by switching between the water, sound, and light tabs. Contrast and compare how the different types of waves behave. Try rotating the view from top to side to make observations. Then experiment with adding a second source or a pair of slits to create an interference pattern. Standing Waves Sometimes waves do not seem to move and they appear to just stand in place, vibrating. Such waves are called standing waves and are formed by the superposition of two or more waves moving in opposite directions. The waves move through each other with their disturbances adding as they go by. If the two waves have the same amplitude and wavelength, then they alternate between constructive and destructive interference. Standing waves created by the superposition of two identical waves moving in opposite directions are illustrated in . A standing wave is created by the superposition of two identical waves moving in opposite directions. The oscillations are at fixed locations in space and result from alternating constructive and destructive interferences. As an example, standing waves can be seen on the surface of a glass of milk in a refrigerator. The vibrations from the refrigerator motor create waves on the milk that oscillate up and down but do not seem to move across the surface. The two waves that produce standing waves may be due to the reflections from the side of the glass. Earthquakes can create standing waves and cause constructive and destructive interferences. As the earthquake waves travel along the surface of Earth and reflect off denser rocks, constructive interference occurs at certain points. As a result, areas closer to the epicenter are not damaged while areas farther from the epicenter are damaged. Standing waves are also found on the strings of musical instruments and are due to reflections of waves from the ends of the string. and show three standing waves that can be created on a string that is fixed at both ends. When the wave reaches the fixed end, it has nowhere else to go but back where it came from, causing the reflection. The nodes are the points where the string does not move; more generally, the nodes are the points where the wave disturbance is zero in a standing wave. The fixed ends of strings must be nodes, too, because the string cannot move there. The antinode is the location of maximum amplitude in standing waves. The standing waves on a string have a frequency that is related to the propagation speed v w of the disturbance on the string. The wavelength λ is determined by the distance between the points where the string is fixed in place. The figure shows a string oscillating with its maximum disturbance as the antinode. The figure shows a string oscillating with multiple nodes. Reflection and Refraction of Waves As we saw in the case of standing waves on the strings of a musical instrument, reflection is the change in direction of a wave when it bounces off a barrier, such as a fixed end. When the wave hits the fixed end, it changes direction, returning to its source. As it is reflected, the wave experiences an inversion, which means that it flips vertically. If a wave hits the fixed end with a crest, it will return as a trough, and vice versa (Henderson 2015). Refer to . A wave is inverted after reflection from a fixed end. If the end is not fixed, it is said to be a free end, and no inversion occurs. When the end is loosely attached, it reflects without inversion, and when the end is not attached to anything, it does not reflect at all. You may have noticed this while changing the settings from Fixed End to Loose End to No End in the Waves on a String PhET simulation. Rather than encountering a fixed end or barrier, waves sometimes pass from one medium into another, for instance, from air into water. Different types of media have different properties, such as density or depth, that affect how a wave travels through them. At the boundary between media, waves experience refraction—they change their path of propagation. As the wave bends, it also changes its speed and wavelength upon entering the new medium. Refer to . A wave refracts as it enters a different medium. For example, water waves traveling from the deep end to the shallow end of a swimming pool experience refraction. They bend in a path closer to perpendicular to the surface of the water, propagate slower, and decrease in wavelength as they enter shallower water.

(B.A. Bowen Photography) Teacher Support [BL][OL][AL] Begin by asking students the old philosophical question given at the start of the chapter, “If a tree falls in the forest and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound?” Ask them to give reasons for their responses. Ask them if they have seen Star Trek or Star Wars. Show a clip where a battle scene is taking place and you are able to hear explosions. Ask students if it is possible to hear another spaceship explode in space. Why or why not? In the discussion, ask them to think about what defines sound. Explain that sound is a mechanical wave. Refresh their memory about different waves and their properties. If a tree falls in a forest (see ) and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound? The answer to this old philosophical question depends on how you define sound. If sound only exists when someone is around to perceive it, then the falling tree produced no sound. However, in physics, we know that colliding objects can disturb the air, water or other matter surrounding them. As a result of the collision, the surrounding particles of matter began vibrating in a wave-like fashion. This is a sound wave. Consequently, if a tree collided with another object in space, no one would hear it, because no sound would be produced. This is because, in space, there is no air, water or other matter to be disturbed and produce sound waves.

Section Key Terms rarefaction sound Teacher Support [BL][OL] Review waves and types of waves—mechanical and non-mechanical, transverse and longitudinal, pulse and periodic. Review properties of waves—amplitude, period, frequency, velocity and their inter-relations. Properties of Sound Waves Sound is a wave. More specifically, sound is defined to be a disturbance of matter that is transmitted from its source outward. A disturbance is anything that is moved from its state of equilibrium. Some sound waves can be characterized as periodic waves, which means that the atoms that make up the matter experience simple harmonic motion. A vibrating string produces a sound wave as illustrated in , , and . As the string oscillates back and forth, part of the string’s energy goes into compressing and expanding the surrounding air. This creates slightly higher and lower pressures. The higher pressure... regions are compressions, and the low pressure regions are rarefactions. The pressure disturbance moves through the air as longitudinal waves with the same frequency as the string. Some of the energy is lost in the form of thermal energy transferred to the air. You may recall from the chapter on waves that areas of compression and rarefaction in longitudinal waves (such as sound) are analogous to crests and troughs in transverse waves. A vibrating string moving to the right compresses the air in front of it and expands the air behind it. As the string moves to the left, it creates another compression and rarefaction as the particles on the right move away from the string. After many vibrations, there is a series of compressions and rarefactions that have been transmitted from the string as a sound wave. The graph shows gauge pressure (Pgauge) versus distance x from the source. Gauge pressure is the pressure relative to atmospheric pressure; it is positive for pressures above atmospheric pressure, and negative for pressures below it. For ordinary, everyday sounds, pressures vary only slightly from average atmospheric pressure. The amplitude of a sound wave decreases with distance from its source, because the energy of the wave is spread over a larger and larger area. But some of the energy is also absorbed by objects, such as the eardrum in , and some of the energy is converted to thermal energy in the air. shows a graph of gauge pressure versus distance from the vibrating string. From this figure, you can see that the compression of a longitudinal wave is analogous to the peak of a transverse wave, and the rarefaction of a longitudinal wave is analogous to the trough of a transverse wave. Just as a transverse wave alternates between peaks and troughs, a longitudinal wave alternates between compression and rarefaction. Sound wave compressions and rarefactions travel up the ear canal and force the eardrum to vibrate. There is a net force on the eardrum, since the sound wave pressures differ from the atmospheric pressure found behind the eardrum. A complicated mechanism converts the vibrations to nerve impulses, which are then interpreted by the brain. The Speed of Sound Teacher Support [BL] Review the fact that sound is a mechanical wave and requires a medium through which it is transmitted. [OL][AL] Ask students if they know the speed of sound and if not, ask them to take a guess. Ask them why the sound of thunder is heard much after the lightning is seen during storms. This phenomenon is also observed during a display of fireworks. Through this discussion, develop the concept that the speed of sound is finite and measurable and is much slower than that of light. The speed of sound varies greatly depending upon the medium it is traveling through. The speed of sound in a medium is determined by a combination of the medium’s rigidity (or compressibility in gases) and its density. The more rigid (or less compressible) the medium, the faster the speed of sound. The greater the density of a medium, the slower the speed of sound. The speed of sound in air is low, because air is compressible. Because liquids and solids are relatively rigid and very difficult to compress, the speed of sound in such media is generally greater than in gases. shows the speed of sound in various media. Since temperature affects density, the speed of sound varies with the temperature of the medium through which it’s traveling to some extent, especially for gases. Teacher Support Students might be confused between rigidity and density and how they affect the speed of sound. The speed of sound is slower in denser media. Solids are denser than gases. However, they are also very rigid, and hence sound travels faster in solids. Stress on the fact that the speed of sound always depends on a combination of these two properties of any medium. Speed of Sound in Various Media Medium vw (m/s) Gases at 0 °C Air 331 Carbon dioxide 259 Oxygen 316 Helium 965 Hydrogen 1290 Liquids at 20 °C Ethanol 1160 Mercury 1450 Water, fresh 1480 Sea water 1540 Human tissue 1540 Solids (longitudinal or bulk) Vulcanized rubber 54 Polyethylene 920 Marble 3810 Glass, Pyrex 5640 Lead 1960 Aluminum 5120 Steel 5960 Teacher Support [BL] Note that in the table, the speed of sound in very rigid materials such as glass, aluminum, and steel ... is quite high, whereas the speed in rubber, which is considerably less rigid, is quite low. The Relationship Between the Speed of Sound and the Frequency and Wavelength of a Sound Wave When fireworks explode in the sky, the light energy is perceived before the sound energy. Sound travels more slowly than light does. (Dominic Alves, Flickr) Sound, like all waves, travels at certain speeds through different media and has the properties of frequency and wavelength. Sound travels much slower than light—you can observe this while watching a fireworks display (see ), since the flash of an explosion is seen before its sound is heard. The relationship between the speed of sound, its frequency, and wavelength is the same as for all waves: v=fλ, where v is the speed of sound (in units of m/s), f is its frequency (in units of hertz), and λ is its wavelength (in units of meters). Recall that wavelength is defined as the distance between adjacent identical parts of a wave. The wavelength of a sound, therefore, is the distance between adjacent identical parts of a sound wave. Just as the distance between adjacent crests in a transverse wave is one wavelength, the distance between adjacent compressions in a sound wave is also one wavelength, as shown in . The frequency of a sound wave is the same as that of the source. For example, a tuning fork vibrating at a given frequency would produce sound waves that oscillate at that same frequency. The frequency of a sound is the number of waves that pass a point per unit time. A sound wave emanates from a source vibrating at a frequency f, propagates at v, and has a wavelength λ . Teacher Support [BL][OL][AL] In musical instruments, shorter strings vibrate faster and hence produce sounds at higher pitches. Fret placements on instruments such as guitars, banjos, and mandolins, are mathematically determined to give the correct interval or change in pitch. When the string is pushed against the fret wire, the string is effectively shortened, changing its pitch. Ask students to experiment with strings of different lengths and observe how the pitch changes in each case. One of the more important properties of sound is that its speed is nearly independent of frequency. If this were not the case, and high-frequency sounds traveled faster, for example, then the farther you were from a band in a football stadium, the more the sound from the low-pitch instruments would lag behind the high-pitch ones. But the music from all instruments arrives in cadence independent of distance, and so all frequencies must travel at nearly the same speed. Recall that v=fλ , and in a given medium under fixed temperature and humidity, v is constant. Therefore, the relationship between f and λ is inverse: The higher the frequency, the shorter the wavelength of a sound wave. Teacher Support Hold a meter stick flat on a desktop, with about 80 cm sticking out over the edge of the desk. Make the meter stick vibrate by pulling the tip down and releasing, while holding the meter stick tight to the desktop. While it is vibrating, move the stick back onto the desktop, shortening the part that is sticking out. Students will see the shortening of the vibrating part of the meter stick, and hear the pitch or number of vibrations go up—an increase in frequency. The speed of sound can change when sound travels from one medium to another. However, the frequency usually remains the same because it is like a driven oscillation and maintains the frequency of the original source. If v changes and f remains the same, then the wavelength λ must change. Since v=fλ , the higher the speed of a sound, the greater its wavelength for a given frequency. Teacher Support [AL] Ask students to predict what would happen if the speeds of sound in air varied by frequency. Sound This simulation lets you see sound waves. Adjust the frequency or amplitude (volume) and you can see and hear how the wave changes. Move the listener around and hear what she hears. Switch to the Two Source Interference tab or the Interference by Reflection tab to experiment with interference and reflection. Make sure to have audio enabled and set to Listener rather than Speaker, or else the sound will not vary as you move the listener around. Voice as a Sound Wave In this lab you will observe the effects of blowing and speaking into a piece of paper in order to compare and contrast different sound waves. sheet of paper tape table Instructions Procedure Suspend a sheet of paper so that the top edge of the paper is fixed and the bottom edge is free to move. You could tape the top edge of the paper to the edge of a table, for example. Gently blow air near the edge of the bottom of the sheet and note how the sheet moves. Speak softly and then louder such that the sounds hit the edge of the bottom of the paper, and note how the sheet moves. Interpret the results. Which sound wave property increases when you are speaking more loudly than softly? amplitude of the wave frequency of the wave speed of the wave wavelength of the wave What Are the Wavelengths of Audible Sounds? Calculate the wavelengths of sounds at the extremes of the audible range, 20 and 20,000 Hz, in conditions where sound travels at 348.7 m/s. Strategy To find wavelength from frequency, we can use v=fλ . Solution (1) Identify the knowns. The values for v and f are given. (2) Solve the relationship between speed, frequency and wavelength for λ . λ= v f . (3) Enter the speed and the minimum frequency to give the maximum wavelength. λ max = 348.7 m/s 20 Hz =17 m≈20 m (1 sig. figure) (4) Enter the speed and the maximum frequency to give the minimum wavelength. λ min = 348.7 m/s 20,000 Hz =0.017 m≈2 cm (1 sig. figure) Discussion Because the product of f multiplied by λ equals a constant velocity in unchanging conditions, the smaller f is, the larger λ must be, and vice versa. Note that you can also easily rearrange the same formula to find frequency or velocity. Practice Problems Echolocation A bat uses sound echoes to find its way about and to catch prey. The time for the echo to return is directly proportional to the distance. Echolocation is the use of reflected sound waves to locate and identify objects. It is used by animals such as bats, dolphins and whales, and is also imitated by humans in SONAR—Sound Navigation and Ranging—and echolocation technology. Bats, dolphins and whales use echolocation to navigate and find food in their environment. They locate an object (or obstacle) by emitting a sound and then sensing the reflected sound waves. Since the speed of sound in air is constant, the time it takes for the sound to travel to the object and back gives the animal a sense of the distance between itself and the object. This is called ranging. shows a bat using echolocation to sense distances. Echolocating animals identify an object by comparing the relative intensity of the sound waves returning to each ear to figure out the angle at which the sound waves were reflected. This gives information about the direction, size and shape of the object. Since there is a slight distance in position between the two ears of an animal, the sound may return to one of the ears with a bit of a delay, which also provides information about the position of the object. For example, if a bear is directly to the right of a bat, the echo will return to the bat’s left ear later than to its right ear. If, however, the bear is directly ahead of the bat, the echo would return to both ears at the same time. For an animal without a sense of sight such as a bat, it is important to know where other animals are as well as what they are; their survival depends on it. Principles of echolocation have been used to develop a variety of useful sensing technologies. SONAR, is used by submarines to detect objects underwater and measure water depth. Unlike animal echolocation, which relies on only one transmitter (a mouth) and two receivers (ears), manmade SONAR uses many transmitters and beams to get a more accurate reading of the environment. Radar technologies use the echo of radio waves to locate clouds and storm systems in weather forecasting, and to locate aircraft for air traffic control. Some new cars use echolocation technology to sense obstacles around the car, and warn the driver who may be about to hit something (or even to automatically parallel park). Echolocation technologies and training systems are being developed to help visually impaired people navigate their everyday environments.

Sound is a disturbance of matter that is transmitted from its source outward in the form of longitudinal waves. The relationship of the speed of sound v, its frequency f, and its wavelength λ is given by v=fλ , which is the same relationship given for all waves. The speed of sound depends upon the medium through which the sound wave is travelling. In a given medium at a specific temperature (or density), the speed of sound v is the same for all frequencies and wavelengths.

Section Key Terms amplitude decibel hearing loudness pitch sound intensity sound intensity level Teacher Support [BL] Review sound, properties of sound waves and characteristics of sound waves. Amplitude, Loudness and Energy of a Sound Wave Noise on crowded roadways like this one in Delhi makes it hard to hear others unless they shout. (Lingaraj G J, Flickr) Teacher Support Students may be confused between amplitude and intensity. While sound intensity is proportional to amplitude, they are different physical quantities. Sound intensity is defined as the sound power per unit area, whereas amplitude is the distance between the resting position and the crest of a wave. In a quiet forest, you can sometimes hear a single leaf fall to the ground. But in a traffic jam filled with honking cars, you may have to shout just so the person next to you can hear .The loudness of a sound is related to how energetically its source is vibrating. In cartoons showing a screaming person, the cartoonist often shows an open mouth with a vibrating uvula (the hanging tissue at the back of the mouth) to represent a loud sound coming from the throat. shows such a cartoon depiction of a bird loudly expressing its opinion. A useful quantity for describing the loudness of sounds is called sound intensity. In general, the intensity of a wave is the power per unit area carried by the wave. Power is the rate at which energy is transferred by the wave. In equation form, intensity I is I= P A , where P is the power through an area A. The SI unit for I is W/m2. The intensity of a sound depends upon its pressure amplitude. The relationship between the intensity of a sound wave and its pressure amplitude (or pressure variation Δp) is I= ( Δp ) 2 2ρ v w , where ρ is the density of the material in which the sound wave travels, in units of kg/m3, and v is the speed of sound in the medium, in units of m/s. Pressure amplitude has units of pascals (Pa) or N/m2. Note that Δp is half the difference between the maximum and minimum pressure in the sound wave. We can see from the equation that the intensity of a sound is proportional to its amplitude squared. The pressure variation is proportional to the amplitude of the oscillation, and so I varies as (Δp)2. This relationship is consistent with the fact that the sound wave is produced by some vibration; the greater its pressure amplitude, the more the air is compressed during the vibration. Because the power of a sound wave is the rate at which energy is transferred, the energy of a sound wave is also proportional to its amplitude squared. Teacher Support [OL][AL] Note from the equation that the intensity of sound is also affected by the density of the material that it travels through. The denser the material, the lower the intensity of sound. Pressure is usually denoted by capital P, but we are using a lowercase p for pressure in this case to distinguish it from power P above. Graphs of the pressures in two sound waves of different intensities. The more intense sound is produced by a source that has larger-amplitude oscillations and has greater pressure maxima and minima. Because pressures are higher in the greater-intensity sound, it can exert larger forces on the objects it encounters. Teacher Support [BL][OL][AL] Ask students whether the pitch of both birds differs. How can they tell by looking at the graph? The Decibel Scale You may have noticed that when people talk about the loudness of a sound, they describe it in units of decibels rather than watts per meter squared. While sound intensity (in W/m2) is the SI unit, the sound intensity level in decibels (dB) is more relevant for how humans perceive sounds. The way our ears perceive sound can be more accurately described by the logarithm of the intensity of a sound rather than the intensity of a sound directly. The sound intensity level β is defined to be β (dB)=10 log 10 ( I I 0 ), where I is sound intensity in watts per meter squared, and I0 = 10–12 W/m2 is a reference intensity. I0 is chosen as the reference point because it is the lowest intensity of sound a person with normal hearing can perceive. The decibel level of a sound having an intensity of 10–12 W/m2 is β = 0 dB, because log10 1 = 0. That is, the threshold of human hearing is 0 decibels. Each factor of 10 in intensity corresponds to 10 dB. For example, a 90 dB sound compared with a 60 dB sound is 30 dB greater, or three factors of 10 (that is, 103 times) as intense. Another example is that if one sound is 107 as intense as another, it is 70 dB higher. Since β is defined in terms of a ratio, it is unit-less. The unit called decibel (dB) is used to indicate that this ratio is multiplied by 10. The sound intensity level is not the same as sound intensity—it tells you the level of the sound relative to a reference intensity rather than the actual intensity. Teacher Support [BL][OL][AL] Note that decibel is different from other units in that it is not an absolute measurement. It is a ratio of two measurements. It is useful, and more widely used because it is closer to how humans perceive sound. Feeling Sound In this lab, you will play music with a heavy beat to literally feel the vibrations and explore what happens when the volume changes. CD player or portable electronic device connected to speakers rock or rap music CD or mp3 a lightweight table Procedure Place the speakers on a light table, and start playing the CD or mp3. Place your hand gently on the table next to the speakers. Increase the volume and note the level when the table just begins to vibrate as the music plays. Increase the reading on the volume control until it doubles. What has happened to the vibrations? Solving Sound Wave Intensity Problems Calculating Sound Intensity Levels: Sound Waves Calculate the sound intensity level in decibels for a sound wave traveling in air at 0 ºC and having a pressure amplitude of 0.656 Pa. Strategy We are given Δp, so we can calculate I using the equation I= ( Δp ) 2 2ρ v . Using I , we can calculate β straight from its definition in β (dB)=10 log 10 ( I I 0 ) β (dB)=10 log 10 ( I I 0 ) . Solution (1) Identify knowns: Sound travels at 331 m/s in air at 0 °C. Air has a density of 1.29 kg/m3 at atmospheric pressure and 0ºC. (2) Enter these values and the pressure amplitude into I= ( Δp ) 2 2ρ v w . I= ( Δp ) 2 2ρ v w = ( 0.656 Pa ) 2 2( 1.29 kg/m 3 )( 331 m/s ) =5.04× 10 −4 W/m 2 . (3) Enter the value for I and the known value for I0 into β (dB)=10 log 10 ( I I 0 ) . Calculate to find the sound intensity level in decibels. 10 log 10 ( 5.04× 10 8 )=10( 8.70 ) dB=87.0 dB. Discussion This 87.0 dB sound has an intensity five times as great as an 80 dB sound. So a factor of five in intensity corresponds to a difference of 7 dB in sound intensity level. This value is true for any intensities differing by a factor of five. Change Intensity Levels of a Sound: What Happens to the Decibel Level? Show that if one sound is twice as intense as another, it has a sound level about 3 dB higher. Strategy You are given that the ratio of two intensities is 2 to 1, and are then asked to find the difference in their sound levels in decibels. You can solve this problem using of the properties of logarithms. Solution (1) Identify knowns: The ratio of the two intensities is 2 to 1, or: I 2 I 1 =2.00. We want to show that the difference in sound levels is about 3 dB. That is, we want to show β 2 − β 1 =3 dB. Note that log 10 b − log 10 a = log 10 ( b a ). (2) Use the definition of β to get β 2 − β 1 =10 log 10 ( I 2 I 1 )=10 log 10 2.00=10( 0.301 ) dB. Therefore, β 2 − β 1 =3.01 dB. Discussion This means that the two sound intensity levels differ by 3.01 dB, or about 3 dB, as advertised. Note that because only the ratio I2/I1 is given (and not the actual intensities), this result is true for any intensities that differ by a factor of two. For example, a 56.0 dB sound is twice as intense as a 53.0 dB sound, a 97.0 dB sound is half as intense as a 100 dB sound, and so on. Practice Problems Calculate the intensity of a wave if the power transferred is 10 W and the area through which the wave is transferred is 5 square meters. 200 W / m2 50 W / m2 0.5 W / m2 2 W / m2 Hearing and Voice People create sounds by pushing air up through their lungs and through elastic folds in the throat called vocal cords. These folds open and close rhythmically, creating a pressure buildup. As air travels up and past the vocal cords, it causes them to vibrate. This vibration escapes the mouth along with puffs of air as sound. A voice changes in pitch when the muscles of the larynx relax or tighten, changing the tension on the vocal chords. A voice becomes louder when air flow from the lungs increases, making the amplitude of the sound pressure wave greater. Hearing is the perception of sound. It can give us plenty of information—such as pitch, loudness, and direction. Humans can normally hear frequencies ranging from approximately 20 to 20,000 Hz. Other animals have hearing ranges different from that of humans. Dogs can hear sounds as high as 45,000 Hz, whereas bats and dolphins can hear up to 110,000 Hz sounds. You may have noticed that dogs respond to the sound of a dog whistle which produces sound out of the range of human hearing. Sounds below 20 Hz are called infrasound, whereas those above 20,000 Hz are ultrasound. The perception of frequency is called pitch, and the perception of intensity is called loudness. The way we hear involves some interesting physics. The sound wave that hits our ear is a pressure wave. The ear converts sound waves into electrical nerve impulses, similar to a microphone. shows the anatomy of the ear with its division into three parts: the outer ear or ear canal; the middle ear, which runs from the eardrum to the cochlea; and the inner ear, which is the cochlea itself. The body part normally referred to as the ear is technically called the pinna. The illustration shows the anatomy of the human ear. The outer ear, or ear canal, carries sound to the eardrum protected inside of the ear. The middle ear converts sound into mechanical vibrations and applies these vibrations to the cochlea. The lever system of the middle ear takes the force exerted on the eardrum by sound pressure variations, amplifies it and transmits it to the inner ear via the oval window. Two muscles in the middle ear protect the inner ear from very intense sounds. They react to intense sound in a few milliseconds and reduce the force transmitted to the cochlea. This protective reaction can also be triggered by your own voice, so that humming during a fireworks display, for example, can reduce noise damage. shows the middle and inner ear in greater detail. As the middle ear bones vibrate, they vibrate the cochlea, which contains fluid. This creates pressure waves in the fluid that cause the tectorial membrane to vibrate. The motion of the tectorial membrane stimulates tiny cilia on specialized cells called hair cells. These hair cells, and their attached neurons, transform the motion of the tectorial membrane into electrical signals that are sent to the brain. The tectorial membrane vibrates at different positions based on the frequency of the incoming sound. This allows us to detect the pitch of sound. Additional processing in the brain also allows us to determine which direction the sound is coming from (based on comparison of the sound’s arrival time and intensity between our two ears). The inner ear, or cochlea, is a coiled tube about 3 mm in diameter and 3 cm in length when uncoiled. As the stapes vibrates against the oval window, it creates pressure waves that travel through fluid in the cochlea. These waves vibrate the tectorial membrane, which bends the cilia and stimulates nerves in the organ of Corti. These nerves then send information about the sound to the brain. Musical Instruments Playing music, also known as “rocking out”, involves creating vibrations using musical instruments. (John Norton) Yet another way that people make sounds is through playing musical instruments (see the previous figure). Recall that the perception of frequency is called pitch. You may have noticed that the pitch range produced by an instrument tends to depend upon its size. Small instruments, such as a piccolo, typically make high-pitch sounds, while larger instruments, such as a tuba, typically make low-pitch sounds. High-pitch means small wavelength, and the size of a musical instrument is directly related to the wavelengths of sound it produces. So a small instrument creates short-wavelength sounds, just as a large instrument creates long-wavelength sounds.Most of us have excellent relative pitch, which means that we can tell whether one sound has a different frequency from another. We can usually distinguish one sound from another if the frequencies of the two sounds differ by as little as 1 Hz. For example, 500.0 and 501.5 Hz are noticeably different. Musical notes are particular sounds that can be produced by most instruments, and are the building blocks of a song. In Western music, musical notes have particular names, such as A-sharp, C, or E-flat. Some people can identify musical notes just by listening to them. This rare ability is called perfect, or absolute, pitch. When a violin plays middle C, there is no mistaking it for a piano playing the same note. The reason is that each instrument produces a distinctive set of frequencies and intensities. We call our perception of these combinations of frequencies and intensities the timbre of the sound. It is more difficult to quantify timbre than loudness or pitch. Timbre is more subjective. Evocative adjectives such as dull, brilliant, warm, cold, pure, and rich are used to describe the timbre of a sound rather than quantities with units, which makes for a difficult topic to dissect with physics. So the consideration of timbre takes us into the realm of perceptual psychology, where higher-level processes in the brain are dominant. This is also true for other perceptions of sound, such as music and noise. But as a teenager, you are likely already aware that one person’s music may be another person’s noise.

If students are struggling with a specific objective, these questions will help identify which and direct students to the relevant content.

Relaxing or tightening their glottis Relaxing or tightening their uvula Relaxing or tightening their tongue Relaxing or tightening their larynx Section Summary The intensity of a sound is proportional to its amplitude squared. The energy of a sound wave is also proportional to its amplitude squared. Sound intensity level in decibels (dB) is more relevant for how humans perceive sounds than sound intensity (in W/m2), even though sound intensity is the SI unit. Sound intensity level is not the same as sound intensity—it tells you the level of the sound relative to a reference intensity rather than the actual intensity. Hearing is the perception of sound and involves that transformation of sound waves into vibrations of parts within the ear. These vibrations are then transformed into neural signals that are interpreted by the brain. People create sounds by pushing air up through their lungs and through elastic folds in the throat called vocal cords.

The student knows the characteristics and behavior of waves. The student is expected to: (D) investigate behaviors of waves, including reflection, refraction, diffraction, interference, resonance, and the Doppler effect. Section Key Terms Doppler effect sonic boom Teacher Support [BL] Before the start of this section, it would be useful to review the properties of sound waves and how they are related to each other. The Doppler Effect of Sound WavesThe Doppler effect is a change in the observed pitch of a sound, due to relative motion between the source and the observer. An example of the Doppler effect due to the motion of a source occurs when you are standing still, and the sound of a siren coming from an ambulance shifts from high-pitch to low-pitch as it passes by. The closer the ambulance is to you, the more sudden the shift. The faster the ambulance moves, the greater the shift. We also hear this shift in frequency for passing race cars, airplanes, and trains. An example of the Doppler effect with a stationary source and moving observer is if you ride a train past a stationary warning bell, you will hear the bell’s frequency shift from high to low as you pass by. Teacher Support [BL][OL][AL] Ask students if they have ever experienced the phenomenon where a car horn or siren appears to change its pitch as the vehicle passes them by. If so, when did it appear to be higher? And when was it lower? You can do a demonstration of the Doppler effect in class using a buzzer and a string. Tie the buzzer to one end of a string. A buzzer produces a monotonous sound. However, when you swing it around your head, its pitch appears to change. Ask students how they think this happens. What could be the reason for the changing pitch? Safety warning: Make sure the buzzer is secured tightly to the string before swinging. What causes the Doppler effect? Let’s compare three different scenarios: Sound waves emitted by a stationary source (), sound waves emitted by a moving source (), and sound waves emitted by a stationary source but heard by moving observers (). In each case, the sound spreads out from the point where it was emitted. If the source and observers are stationary, then observers on either side see the same wavelength and frequency as emitted by the source. But if the source is moving and continues to emit sound as it travels, then the air compressions (crests) become closer together in the direction in which it’s traveling and farther apart in the direction it’s traveling away from. Therefore, the wavelength is shorter in the direction the source is moving (on the right in ), and longer in the opposite direction (on the left in ). Finally, if the observers move, as in , the frequency at which they receive the compressions changes. The observer moving toward the source receives them at a higher frequency (and therefore shorter wavelength), and the person moving away from the source receives them at a lower frequency (and therefore longer wavelength). Teacher Support Be sure to point out that the Doppler effect is only experienced due to the relative motion between the source and the observer and does not depend on the actual speed of either. Students might think that the Doppler effect occurs only with sound waves. This is not the case. It can occur with any kind of waves. In fact, we see it in the light waves that reach us from distant stars. Here, the effect is observed in the form of color change. Sounds emitted by a source spread out in spherical waves. Because the source, observers, and air are stationary, the wavelength and frequency are the same in all directions and to all observers. Sounds emitted by a source moving to the right spread out from the points at which they were emitted. The wavelength is reduced and, consequently, the frequency is increased in the direction of motion, so that the observer on the right hears a higher-pitch sound. The opposite is true for the observer on the left, where the wavelength is increased and the frequency is reduced. The same effect is produced when the observers move relative to the source. Motion toward the source increases frequency as the observer on the right passes through more wave crests than she would if stationary. Motion away from the source decreases frequency as the observer on the left passes through fewer wave crests than he would if stationary. We know that wavelength and frequency are related by v=fλ, where v is the fixed speed of sound. The sound moves in a medium and has the same speed v in that medium whether the source is moving or not. Therefore, f multiplied by λ is a constant. Because the observer on the right in receives a shorter wavelength, the frequency she perceives must be higher. Similarly, the observer on the left receives a longer wavelength and therefore perceives a lower frequency. The same thing happens in . A higher frequency is perceived by the observer moving toward the source, and a lower frequency is perceived by an observer moving away from the source. In general, then, relative motion of source and observer toward one another increases the perceived frequency. Relative motion apart decreases the perceived frequency. The greater the relative speed is, the greater the effect. Introduction to the Doppler Effect This video explains the Doppler effect visually. If you are standing on the sidewalk facing the street and an ambulance drives by with its siren blaring, at what point will the frequency that you observe most closely match the actual frequency of the siren? when it is coming toward you when it is going away from you when it is in front of you For a stationary observer and a moving source of sound, the frequency (fobs) of sound perceived by the observer is f obs = f s ( v w v w ± v s ), where fs is the frequency of sound from a source, vs is the speed of the source along a line joining the source and observer, and vw is the speed of sound. The minus sign is used for motion toward the observer and the plus sign for motion away from the observer. Rather than just memorizing rules, which are easy to forget, it is better to think about the rules of an equation intuitively. Using a minus sign in f obs = f s ( v w v w ± v s ) will decrease the denominator and increase the observed frequency, which is consistent with the expected outcome of the Doppler effect when the source is moving toward the observer. Using a plus sign will increase the denominator and decrease the observed frequency, consistent with what you would expect for the source moving away from the observer. This may be more helpful to keep in mind rather than memorizing the fact that “the minus sign is used for motion toward the observer and the plus sign for motion away from the observer.” Note that the greater the speed of the source, the greater the Doppler effect. Similarly, for a stationary source and moving observer, the frequency perceived by the observer fobs is given by f obs = f s ( v w ± v obs v w ), where vobs is the speed of the observer along a line joining the source and observer. Here the plus sign is for motion toward the source, and the minus sign is for motion away from the source. Sonic Booms What happens to the sound produced by a moving source, such as a jet airplane, that approaches or even exceeds the speed of sound? Suppose a jet airplane is coming nearly straight at you, emitting a sound of frequency fs. The greater the plane’s speed, vs, the greater the Doppler shift and the greater the value of fobs. Now, as vs approaches the speed of sound, vw, fobs approaches infinity, because the denominator in f obs = f s ( v w v w − v s ) approaches zero. Teacher Support [BL][OL][AL]The equation shows that a sonic boom is created as the observed frequency approaches infinity. Ask students what happens to the amplitude of the sound wave at this time. The Doppler effect only changes the frequency of the sound. However, when all the waves are superimposed on one another, and their crests match, the amplitude will also tend to infinity. This is what increases the intensity of the wave, creating the boom. This result means that at the speed of sound, in front of the source, each wave is superimposed on the previous one because the source moves forward at the speed of sound. The observer gets them all at the same instant, and so the frequency is theoretically infinite. If the source exceeds the speed of sound, no sound is received by the observer until the source has passed, so that the sounds from the source when it was approaching are stacked up with those from it when receding, creating a sonic boom. A sonic boom is a constructive interference of sound created by an object moving faster than sound. An aircraft creates two sonic booms, one from its nose and one from its tail (see ). During television coverage of space shuttle landings, two distinct booms could often be heard. These were separated by exactly the time it would take the shuttle to pass by a point. Observers on the ground often do not observe the aircraft creating the sonic boom, because it has passed by before the shock wave reaches them. If the aircraft flies close by at low altitude, pressures in the sonic boom can be destructive enough to break windows. Because of this, supersonic flights are banned over populated areas of the United States. Two sonic booms, created by the nose and tail of an aircraft, are observed on the ground after the plane has passed by. Solving Problems Using the Doppler Shift Formula Doppler Effect Formula for Observed Frequency This video explains the Doppler effect formula for cases when the source is moving toward the observer. Lets say that you have a rare phobia where you are afraid of the Doppler effect. If you see an ambulance coming your way, what would be the best Strategy to minimize the Doppler effect and soothe your Doppleraphobia? Stop moving and become stationary till it passes by. Run toward the ambulance. Run alongside the ambulance. Doppler Effect Formula When Source is Moving Away This video explains the Doppler effect formula for cases when the source is moving away from the observer. Calculate Doppler Shift: A Train Horn Suppose a train that has a 150 Hz horn is moving at 35 m/s in still air on a day when the speed of sound is 340 m/s. What frequencies are observed by a stationary person at the side of the tracks as the train approaches and after it passes? Strategy To find the observed frequency, f obs = f s ( v w v w ± v s ) must be used because the source is moving. The minus sign is used for the approaching train, and the plus sign for the receding train. Solution (1) Enter known values into f obs = f s ( v w v w − v s ) to calculate the frequency observed by a stationary person as the train approaches: f obs = f s ( v w v w − v s )=( 150 Hz )( 340 m/s 340 m/s−35 m/s ) =167 Hz≈170 Hz (2 sig. figs.) (2) Use the same equation but with the plus sign to find the frequency heard by a stationary person as the train recedes. f obs = f s ( v w v w + v s )=( 150 Hz )( 340 m/s 340 m/s+35 m/s ) =136 Hz≈140 Hz (2 sig. figs.) Discussion The numbers calculated are valid when the train is far enough away that the motion is nearly along the line joining the train and the observer. In both cases, the shift is significant and easily noticed. Note that the shift is approximately 20 Hz for motion toward and approximately 10 Hz for motion away. The shifts are not symmetric. Practice Problems Check Your Understanding Teacher Support Use these questions to assess student achievement of the section’s Learning Objectives. If students are struggling with a specific objective, these questions will help identify which and direct students to the relevant content. Give an example of the Doppler effect caused by motion of the source. The sound of a vehicle horn shifts from low-pitch to high-pitch as we move towards it. The sound of a vehicle horn shifts from low-pitch to high-pitch as we move away from it. The sound of a vehicle horn shifts from low-pitch to high-pitch as it passes by. The sound of a vehicle horn shifts from high-pitch to low-pitch as it passes by. Section Summary The Doppler effect is a shift in the observed frequency of a sound due to motion of either the source or the observer. The observed frequency is greater than the actual source’s frequency when the source and the observer are moving closer together, either by the source moving toward the observer or the observer moving toward the source. A sonic boom is constructive interference of sound created by an object moving faster than sound. Key Equations Doppler effect observed frequency (moving source) f obs = f s ( v w v w ± v s ) Doppler effect observed frequency (moving observer) f obs = f s ( v w ± v obs v w ) Concept Items Two sources of sound producing the same frequency are moving towards you at different speeds. Which one would sound more high-pitched? the one moving slower the one moving faster Critical Thinking When the source of sound is moving through the air, does the speed of sound change with respect to a stationary person standing nearby? Yes No Problems Test Prep Multiple Choice Test Prep Short Answer True or false—The Doppler effect also occurs with waves other than sound waves. False True What is the frequency of a stationary sound source if you hear it at 1200.0 Hz while moving towards it at a speed of 50.0 m/s? (Assume speed of sound to be 331 m/s.) 1410 Hz 1380 Hz 1020 Hz 1042 Hz Test Prep Extended Response True or false—The Doppler effect occurs only when the sound source is moving. False True True or false—The observed frequency becomes infinite when the source is moving at the speed of sound. False True You are driving alongside a train. You hear its horn at a pitch that is lower than the actual frequency. What should you do to match the speed of the train? Why? In order to match the speed of the train, one would need to increase or decrease the speed of his/her car because a lower pitch means that either the train (the source) is moving away or that you (the observer) are moving away. In order to match the speed of the train, one would need to drive at a constant speed because a lower pitch means that the train and the car are at the same speed.

Section Key Terms beat beat frequency damping fundamental harmonics natural frequency overtones resonance resonate Teacher Support [BL]Before the start of this section, it would be useful to review the properties of sound waves and how they are related to each other, standing waves, superposition and interference of waves. Resonance and Beats Sit in front of a piano sometime and sing a loud brief note at it while pushing down on the sustain pedal. It will sing the same note back at you—the strings that have the same frequencies as your voice, are resonating in response to the forces from the sound waves that you sent to them. This is a good example of the fact that objects—in this case, piano strings—can be forced to oscillate but oscillate best at their natural frequency. A driving force (such as your voice in the example) puts energy into a system at a certain frequency, which is not necessarily the same as the natural frequency of the system. Over time the energy dissipates, and the amplitude gradually reduces to zero- this is called damping. The natural frequency is the frequency at which a system would oscillate if there were no driving and no damping force. The phenomenon of driving a system with a frequency equal to its natural frequency is called resonance, and a system being driven at its natural frequency is said to resonate. Most of us have played with toys where an object bobs up and down on an elastic band, something like the paddle ball suspended from a finger in . At first you hold your finger steady, and the ball bounces up and down with a small amount of damping. If you move your finger up and down slowly, the ball will follow along without bouncing much on its own. As you increase the frequency at which you move your finger up and down, the ball will respond by oscillating with increasing amplitude. When you drive the ball at its natural frequency, the ball’s oscillations increase in amplitude with each oscillation for as long as you drive it. As the driving frequency gets progressively higher than the resonant or natural frequency, the amplitude of the oscillations becomes smaller, until the oscillations nearly disappear and your finger simply moves up and down with little effect on the ball. The paddle ball on its rubber band moves in response to the finger supporting it. If the finger moves with the natural frequency of the ball on the rubber band, then a resonance is achieved, and the amplitude of the ball’s oscillations increases dramatically. At higher and lower driving frequencies, energy is transferred to the ball less efficiently, and it responds with lower-amplitude oscillations. Another example is that when you tune a radio, you adjust its resonant frequency so that it oscillates only at the desired station’s broadcast (driving) frequency. Also, a child on a swing is driven (pushed) by a parent at the swing’s natural frequency to reach the maximum amplitude (height). In all of these cases, the efficiency of energy transfer from the driving force into the oscillator is best at resonance. Some types of headphones use the phenomena of constructive and destructive interference to cancel out outside noises. Teacher Support [BL][OL][AL] Tuning forks and pipes may be used to demonstrate the concept of resonance. Use any pipe or tube closed at one end. Fix it so that it stands upright with the open end on top. Choose a tuning fork and strike it to make it vibrate. Place it near the mouth of the pipe and hear the sound. Now fill the pipe with some water and repeat. The changing water level changes the length of the resonating air column. Continue doing this. When a certain length is obtained, the sound of the tuning fork will resonate through the column. All sound resonances are due to constructive and destructive interference. Only the resonant frequencies interfere constructively to form standing waves, while others interfere destructively and are absent. From the toot made by blowing over a bottle to the recognizability of a great singer’s voice, resonance and standing waves play a vital role in sound. Interference happens to all types of waves, including sound waves. In fact, one way to support that something is a wave is to observe interference effects. shows a set of headphones that employs a clever use of sound interference to cancel noise. To get destructive interference, a fast electronic analysis is performed, and a second sound is introduced with its maxima and minima exactly reversed from the incoming noise. In addition to resonance, superposition of waves can also create beats. Beats are produced by the superposition of two waves with slightly different frequencies but the same amplitude. The waves alternate in time between constructive interference and destructive interference, giving the resultant wave an amplitude that varies over time. (See the resultant wave in ).This wave fluctuates in amplitude, or beats, with a frequency called the beat frequency. The equation for beat frequency is f B =| f 1 − f 2 |, where f1 and f2 are the frequencies of the two original waves. If the two frequencies of sound waves are similar, then what we hear is an average frequency that gets louder and softer at the beat frequency. Don’t confuse the beat frequency with the regular frequency of a wave resulting from superposition. While the beat frequency is given by the formula above, and describes the frequency of the beats, the actual frequency of the wave resulting from superposition is the average of the frequencies of the two original waves. Beats are produced by the superposition of two waves of slightly different frequencies but identical amplitudes. The waves alternate in time between constructive interference and destructive interference, giving the resulting wave a time-varying amplitude. Wave Interference For this activity, switch to the Sound tab. Turn on the Sound option, and experiment with changing the frequency and amplitude, and adding in a second speaker and a barrier. Fundamental Frequency and Harmonics Suppose we hold a tuning fork near the end of a tube that is closed at the other end, as shown in , , and . If the tuning fork has just the right frequency, the air column in the tube resonates loudly, but at most frequencies it vibrates very little. This means that the air column has only certain natural frequencies. The figures show how a resonance at the lowest of these natural frequencies is formed. A disturbance travels down the tube at the speed of sound and bounces off the closed end. If the tube is just the right length, the reflected sound arrives back at the tuning fork exactly half a cycle later, and it interferes constructively with the continuing sound produced by the tuning fork. The incoming and reflected sounds form a standing wave in the tube as shown. Resonance of air in a tube closed at one end, caused by a tuning fork. A disturbance moves down the tube. Resonance of air in a tube closed at one end, caused by a tuning fork. The disturbance reflects from the closed end of the tube. Resonance of air in a tube closed at one end, caused by a tuning fork. If the length of the tube L is just right, the disturbance gets back to the tuning fork half a cycle later and interferes constructively with the continuing sound from the tuning fork. This interference forms a standing wave, and the air column resonates. The standing wave formed in the tube has its maximum air displacement (an antinode) at the open end, and no displacement (a node) at the closed end. Recall from the last chapter on waves that motion is unconstrained at the antinode, and halted at the node. The distance from a node to an antinode is one-fourth of a wavelength, and this equals the length of the tube; therefore, λ= 4L . This same resonance can be produced by a vibration introduced at or near the closed end of the tube, as shown in . The same standing wave is created in the tube by a vibration introduced near its closed end. Since maximum air displacements are possible at the open end and none at the closed end, there are other, shorter wavelengths that can resonate in the tube see ). Here the standing wave has three-fourths of its wavelength in the tube, or L= ( 3/4 )λ′ , so that λ′ = 4L/3 . There is a whole series of shorter-wavelength and higher-frequency sounds that resonate in the tube. We use specific terms for the resonances in any system. The lowest resonant frequency is called the fundamental, while all higher resonant frequencies are called overtones. All resonant frequencies are multiples of the fundamental, and are called harmonics. The fundamental is the first harmonic, the first overtone is the second harmonic, and so on. shows the fundamental and the first three overtones (the first four harmonics) in a tube closed at one end. Another resonance for a tube closed at one end. This has maximum air displacements at the open end, and none at the closed end. The wavelength is shorter, with three-fourths λ′ equaling the length of the tube, so that λ′ = 4L/3 . This higher-frequency vibration is the first overtone. The fundamental and three lowest overtones for a tube closed at one end. All have maximum air displacements at the open end and none at the closed end. The fundamental and overtones can be present at the same time in a variety of combinations. For example, the note middle C on a trumpet sounds very different from middle C on a clarinet, even though both instruments are basically modified versions of a tube closed at one end. The fundamental frequency is the same (and usually the most intense), but the overtones and their mix of intensities are different. This mix is what gives musical instruments (and human voices) their distinctive characteristics, whether they have air columns, strings, or drumheads. In fact, much of our speech is determined by shaping the cavity formed by the throat and mouth and positioning the tongue to adjust the fundamental and combination of overtones. Open-Pipe and Closed-Pipe Resonators The resonant frequencies of a tube closed at one end (known as a closed-pipe resonator) are f n =n v 4L , n=1,3,5..., where f1 is the fundamental, f3 is the first overtone, and so on. Note that the resonant frequencies depend on the speed of sound v and on the length of the tube L. Another type of tube is one that is open at both ends (known as an open-pipe resonator). Examples are some organ pipes, flutes, and oboes. The air columns in tubes open at both ends have maximum air displacements at both ends. (See ). Standing waves form as shown. The resonant frequencies of a tube open at both ends are shown, including the fundamental and the first three overtones. In all cases the maximum air displacements occur at both ends of the tube, giving it different natural frequencies than a tube closed at one end. The resonant frequencies of an open-pipe resonator are f n =n v 2L , n=1,2,3..., where f1 is the fundamental, f2 is the first overtone, f3 is the second overtone, and so on. Note that a tube open at both ends has a fundamental frequency twice what it would have if closed at one end. It also has a different spectrum of overtones than a tube closed at one end. So if you had two tubes with the same fundamental frequency but one was open at both ends and the other was closed at one end, they would sound different when played because they have different overtones. Middle C, for example, would sound richer played on an open tube since it has more overtones. An open-pipe resonator has more overtones than a closed-pipe resonator because it has even multiples of the fundamental as well as odd, whereas a closed tube has only odd multiples. In this section we have covered resonance and standing waves for wind instruments, but vibrating strings on stringed instruments also resonate and have fundamentals and overtones similar to those for wind instruments. Teacher Support [BL][OL][AL] Other instruments also use air resonance in different ways to amplify sound. For instance, a violin and a guitar both have sounding boxes but with different shapes, resulting in different overtone structures. The vibrating string creates a sound that resonates in the sounding box, greatly amplifying the sound and creating overtones that give the instrument its characteristic flavor. The more complex the shape of the sounding box, the greater its ability to resonate over a wide range of frequencies. The type and thickness of wood or other materials used to make the sounding box also affects the quality of sound. Ask students to give more examples of how different musical instruments use the phenomenon of resonance. Solving Problems Involving Harmonic Series and Beat Frequency Finding the Length of a Tube for a Closed-Pipe Resonator If sound travels through the air at a speed of 344 m/s, what should be the length of a tube closed at one end to have a fundamental frequency of 128 Hz? Strategy The length L can be found by rearranging the equation f n =n v 4L . Solution (1) Identify knowns. The fundamental frequency is 128 Hz. The speed of sound is 344 m/s. (2) Use f n =n v w 4L to find the fundamental frequency (n = 1). f 1 = v 4L (3) Solve this equation for length. L= v 4 f 1 (4) Enter the values of the speed of sound and frequency into the expression for L. L= v 4 f 1 = 344 m/s 4( 128 Hz ) =0.672 m Discussion Many wind instruments are modified tubes that have finger holes, valves, and other devices for changing the length of the resonating air column and therefore, the frequency of the note played. Horns producing very low frequencies, such as tubas, require tubes so long that they are coiled into loops. Finding the Third Overtone in an Open-Pipe Resonator If a tube that’s open at both ends has a fundamental frequency of 120 Hz, what is the frequency of its third overtone? Strategy Since we already know the value of the fundamental frequency (n = 1), we can solve for the third overtone (n = 4) using the equation f n =n v 2L . Solution Since fundamental frequency (n = 1) is f 1 = v 2L , and f 4 =4 v 2L , f 4 =4 f 1 =4(120 Hz)=480 Hz. Discussion To solve this problem, it wasn’t necessary to know the length of the tube or the speed of the air because of the relationship between the fundamental and the third overtone. This example was of an open-pipe resonator; note that for a closed-pipe resonator, the third overtone has a value of n = 7 (not n = 4). Using Beat Frequency to Tune a Piano Piano tuners use beats routinely in their work. When comparing a note with a tuning fork, they listen for beats and adjust the string until the beats go away (to zero frequency). If a piano tuner hears two beats per second, and the tuning fork has a frequency of 256 Hz, what are the possible frequencies of the piano? Strategy Since we already know that the beat frequency fB is 2, and one of the frequencies (let’s say f2) is 256 Hz, we can use the equation f B =| f 1 − f 2 | to solve for the frequency of the piano f1. Solution Since f B =| f 1 − f 2 | , we know that either f B = f 1 − f 2 or − f B = f 1 − f 2 . Solving for f1, f 1 = f B + f 2 or f 1 =− f B + f 2 . Substituting in values, f 1 =2+256 Hz or f 1 =−2+256 Hz So, f 1 =258 Hz or 254 Hz. Discussion The piano tuner might not initially be able to tell simply by listening whether the frequency of the piano is too high or too low and must tune it by trial and error, making an adjustment and then testing it again. If there are even more beats after the adjustment, then the tuner knows that he went in the wrong direction. Practice Problems Check Your Understanding Teacher Support Use these questions to assess student achievement of the section’s Learning Objectives. If students are struggling with a specific objective, these questions will help identify it and direct students to the relevant content.

Recall that the tube has one open end and one closed end. At the midpoint of the tube Both ends of the tube At the closed end of the tube At the open end of the tube In the tuning fork and tube experiment, when will the air column produce the loudest sound? If the tuning fork vibrates at a frequency twice that of the natural frequency of the air column. If the tuning fork vibrates at a frequency lower than the natural frequency of the air column. If the tuning fork vibrates at a frequency higher than the natural frequency of the air column. If the tuning fork vibrates at a frequency equal to the natural frequency of the air column.

A periodic force driving a harmonic oscillator at its natural frequency produces resonance. The system is said to resonate. Beats occur when waves of slightly different frequencies are superimposed. In air columns, the lowest-frequency resonance is called the fundamental, whereas all higher resonant frequencies are called overtones. Collectively, they are called harmonics.

Section Key Terms electric field electromagnetic radiation (EMR) magnetic field Maxwell’s equations Teacher Support [BL]Explain that the term spectrum refers to a physical property that has a broad range with values that are continuous in some cases and, in other cases, discrete. Ask for other examples of spectra, for example, sound, people’s heights, etc. [OL]Ask students to name ways that sunlight affects Earth. Provide examples that students don’t name: photosynthesis, weather, climate, seasons, warming, etc. Discuss energy transformations that take place after light enters the atmosphere, such as transformations in food chains and ecosystems. Ask students if they can explain how the energy in fossil fuels was originally light energy. The light we can see is called visible light. Dispel any misconceptions that visible light is somehow different from radiation we cannot see, except for frequency and wavelength. The fact that some radiation is visible has to do with how the eye functions, not with the radiation itself. The Electromagnetic SpectrumWe generally take light for granted, but it is a truly amazing and mysterious form of energy. Think about it: Light travels to Earth across millions of kilometers of empty space. When it reaches us, it interacts with matter in various ways to generate almost all the energy needed to support life, provide heat, and cause weather patterns. Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation (EMR). The term light usually refers to visible light, but this is not the only form of EMR. As we will see, visible light occupies a narrow band in a broad range of types of electromagnetic radiation. Teacher Support [OL]Discuss electric, magnetic, and gravitational fields. Point out how these three fields are similar, and how they differ. [AL]Describe vectors as having magnitude and direction, and explain that fields are vector quantities. In these cases, the fields are made up of forces acting in a direction. Electromagnetic radiation is generated by a moving electric charge, that is, by an electric current. As you will see when you study electricity, an electric current generates both an electric field, E, and a magnetic field, B. These fields are perpendicular to each other. When the moving charge oscillates, as in an alternating current, an EM wave is propagated. shows how an electromagnetic wave moves away from the source—indicated by the ~ symbol. Teacher Support [BL]Review wave properties: frequency, wavelength, and amplitude. Ask students to recall sound and water waves, and explain how they relate to these properties. [OL]Explain that an important difference between EM waves and other waves is that they can travel across empty space.[AL]Ask if students remember the differences between longitudinal and transverse waves. Give examples. Explain that waves carry energy, not matter. Electromagnetic Waves and the Electromagnetic Spectrum This video, link below, is closely related to the following figure. If you have questions about EM wave properties, the EM spectrum, how waves propagate, or definitions of any of the related terms, the answers can be found in this video. In an electromagnetic wave, how are the magnetic field, the electric field, and the direction of propagation oriented to each other? All three are parallel to each other and are along the x-axis. All three are mutually perpendicular to each other. The electric field and magnetic fields are parallel to each other and perpendicular to the direction of propagation. The magnetic field and direction of propagation are parallel to each other along the y-axis and perpendicular to the electric field. Teacher Support Direct students to use this video as a way of connecting to the information in the following two figures, as well as to the following table. Radio Waves and Electromagnetic Fields This simulation demonstrates wave propagation. The EM wave is propagated from the broadcast tower on the left, just as in . You can make the wave yourself or allow the animation to send it. When the wave reaches the antenna on the right, it causes an oscillating current. This is how radio and television signals are transmitted and received. Where do radio waves fall on the electromagnetic spectrum? Radio waves have the same wavelengths as visible light. Radio waves fall on the high-frequency side of visible light. Radio waves fall on the short-wavelength side of visible light. Radio waves fall on the low-frequency side of visible light. Teacher Support Connect the discussion from the previous video, in which the generation of an electromagnetic wave is described, to this application of transmission and reception of electromagnetic waves. In particular, point out how the reception of the radio wave is essentially identical to the method by which the wave is generated. Explain also that these electromagnetic waves are the carrier waves on which audio or visual signals—either analog or digital—are placed, so that they can be transmitted to receivers within a certain range of the broadcast antenna. A part of the electromagnetic wave sent out from an oscillating charge at one instant in time. The electric and magnetic fields (E and B) are in phase, and they are perpendicular to each other and to the direction of propagation. For clarity, the waves are shown only along one direction, but they propagate out in other directions too. From your study of sound waves, recall these features that apply to all types of waves: Wavelength—The distance between two wave crests or two wave troughs, expressed in various metric measures of distance Frequency—The number of wave crests that pass a point per second, expressed in hertz (Hz or s–1) Amplitude: The height of the crest above the null point As mentioned, electromagnetic radiation takes several forms. These forms are characterized by a range of frequencies. Because frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength, any form of EMR can also be represented by its range of wavelengths. shows the frequency and wavelength ranges of various types of EMR. With how many of these types are you familiar? The electromagnetic spectrum, showing the major categories of electromagnetic waves. The range of frequencies and wavelengths is remarkable. The dividing line between some categories is distinct, whereas other categories overlap. Take a few minutes to study the positions of the various types of radiation on the EM spectrum, above. The narrow band that is visible light extends from lower-frequency red light to higher-frequency violet light. Frequencies just below the visible are called infrared (below red) and those just above are ultraviolet (beyond violet). Radio waves, which overlap with the frequencies used for media broadcasts of TV and radio signals, occupy frequencies even lower than infrared (IR). The microwave radiation that you see on the diagram is the same radiation that is used in a microwave oven. What we feel as radiant heat is also a form of low-frequency EMR. The high-frequency radiation to the right of ultraviolet (UV) includes X-rays and gamma (γ) rays. Teacher Support [BL]Notice that most harmful forms of EM radiation are on the high-frequency end of the spectrum. [OL]Ask which forms of EM radiation students have heard about. Ask them to describe the types of radiation they remember, and correct any misconceptions. Discuss the difference between ionizing radiation and nonionizing radiation, and the difference between electromagnetic radiation and other types of radiation—alpha, beta, etc. Heat waves, a type of infrared radiation, are basically no different from other EM waves. We feel them as heat because they have a frequency that interacts with our bodies in a way that transforms EM energy into thermal energy. Maxwell’s Equations The Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell (1831–1879) is regarded widely to have been the greatest theoretical physicist of the nineteenth century. Although he died young, Maxwell not only formulated a complete electromagnetic theory, represented by Maxwell’s equations, he also developed the kinetic theory of gases, and made significant contributions to the understanding of color vision and the nature of Saturn’s rings. Maxwell brought together all the work that had been done by brilliant physicists, such as Ørsted, Coulomb, Ampere, Gauss, and Faraday, and added his own insights to develop the overarching theory of electromagnetism. Maxwell’s equations are paraphrased here in words because their mathematical content is beyond the level of this text. However, the equations illustrate how apparently simple mathematical statements can elegantly unite and express a multitude of concepts—why mathematics is the language of science. Maxwell’s Equations Electric field lines originate on positive charges and terminate on negative charges. The electric field is defined as the force per unit charge on a test charge, and the strength of the force is related to the electric constant, ε0. Magnetic field lines are continuous, having no beginning or end. No magnetic monopoles are known to exist. The strength of the magnetic force is related to the magnetic constant, μ0. A changing magnetic field induces an electromotive force (emf) and, hence, an electric field. The direction of the emf opposes the change, changing direction of the magnetic field. Magnetic fields are generated by moving charges or by changing electric fields. Maxwell’s complete theory shows that electric and magnetic forces are not separate, but different manifestations of the same thing—the electromagnetic force. This classical unification of forces is one motivation for current attempts to unify the four basic forces in nature—the gravitational, electromagnetic, strong nuclear, and weak nuclear forces. The weak nuclear and electromagnetic forces have been unified, and further unification with the strong nuclear force is expected; but, the unification of the gravitational force with the other three has proven to be a real head-scratcher. One final accomplishment of Maxwell was his development in 1855 of a process that could produce color photographic images. In 1861, he and photographer Thomas Sutton worked together on this process. The color image was achieved by projecting red, blue, and green light through black-and-white photographs of a tartan ribbon, each photo itself exposed in different-colored light. The final image was projected onto a screen (see ). Maxwell and Sutton’s photograph of a colored ribbon. This was the first durable color photograph. The plaid tartan of the Scots made a colorful photographic subject. Teacher Support Features that encouraged mathematicians and physicists to accept Maxwell’s equations is that they are seen as being both elegant and—considering the difference between an electric charge and a magnetic dipole, which give rise to the respective fields—essentially symmetrical. When scientists are looking for an approach to developing a new theory, they usually begin with the simplest and most symmetrical explanations. An example of such symmetry is the fact that electrons and protons have equal and opposite charges. You can see the symmetry in the four statements, given above, that describe the equations. The first two statements show a similar treatment of electric and magnetic fields, and the last two describe how a magnetic field can generate an electric field, and vice versa. From our present-day perspective, we can now see the significance of Maxwell’s equations. This was the first step in the quest to unify all natural forces under one theory. After Maxwell unified the electric and magnetic forces as the electromagnetic force, others unified this force with the weak nuclear force, and there is evidence that the strong nuclear force can be unified with the electroweak force. The only force that has resisted unification with the others is the gravitational force. A theory that would unify all forces is often referred as a grand unified theory or a theory of everything. The quest for such a theory is still underway. Characteristics of Electromagnetic Radiation All the EM waves mentioned above are basically the same form of radiation. They can all travel across empty space, and they all travel at the speed of light in a vacuum. The basic difference between types of radiation is their differing frequencies. Each frequency has an associated wavelength. As frequency increases across the spectrum, wavelength decreases. Energy also increases with frequency. Because of this, higher frequencies penetrate matter more readily. Some of the properties and uses of the various EM spectrum bands are listed in . Teacher Support [BL]Explain transparency and opacity. Discuss how some materials are transparent to certain frequencies but opaque to others. Ask students for examples of materials that can be penetrated by some EM frequencies but not by others. Ask for examples of materials that are transparent to visible light and materials that are opaque to visible light. [OL]Ask students why a lead apron is laid across dental patients during dental X-rays. Explain that X-rays are at the high-energy end of the spectrum and that they are very penetrating. They are only stopped by very dense materials, such as lead. [AL]Ask if students can explain Earth’s greenhouse effect in terms of the penetrating power of various frequencies of EM radiation. Explain that the atmosphere is more transparent to visible light than to heat waves. Visible light penetrates the atmosphere and warms Earth’s surface. The heated surface radiates heat waves, which are trapped partially by certain gases in the atmosphere.

The narrow band of visible light is a combination of the colors of the rainbow. shows the section of the EM spectrum that includes visible light. The frequencies corresponding to these wavelengths are 4.0× 10 14 s −1 at the red end to 7.9× 10 14 s −1 at the violet end. This is a very narrow range, considering that the EM spectrum spans about 20 orders of magnitude. A small part of the electromagnetic spectrum that includes its visible components. The divisions between infrared, visible, and ultraviolet are not perfectly distinct, nor are the divisions between the seven rainbow colors Teacher Support [BL]Review the primary and secondary colors of pigments. Note that this is subtractive color mixing. [OL]Explain the difference between subtractive and additive color mixing. The colors on the subtractive color wheel are made by pigments that absorb all colors but one. Therefore, when these colors all overlap, all light is absorbed and the result is black. White light is a combination of all colors, so when all colors are added together on the additive color wheel, the result is white. Explain that cyan is a shade of blue and that magenta is a shade of red. Wavelengths of visible light are often given in nanometers, nm. One nm equals 10 −9 m. For example, yellow light has a wavelength of about 600 nm, or 6× 10 −7 m. As a child, you probably learned the color wheel, shown on the left in . It helps if you know what color results when you mix different colors of paint together. Mixing two of the primary pigment colors—magenta, yellow, or cyan—together results in a secondary color. For example, mixing cyan and yellow makes green. This is called subtractive color mixing. Mixing different colors of light together is quite different. The diagram on the right shows additive color mixing. In this case, the primary colors are red, green, and blue, and the secondary colors are cyan, magenta, and yellow. Mixing pigments and mixing light are different because materials absorb light by a different set of rules than does the perception of light by the eye. Notice that, when all colors are subtracted, the result is no color, or black. When all colors are added, the result is white light. We see the reverse of this when white sunlight is separated into the visible spectrum by a prism or by raindrops when a rainbow appears in the sky. Mixing colored pigments follows the subtractive color wheel, and mixing colored light follows the additive color wheel. Color Vision This video demonstrates additive color and color filters. Try all the settings except Photons. Teacher Support Have students adjust the different colored lights for the RGB bulb simulation, first with individual settings, then with combinations of two and three colors to see what colors result and are perceived. Similarly, with the Single Bulb simulation, have students note how different filter settings affect what colors are seen for light with different color components. Animal Color Perception The physics of color perception has interesting links to zoology. Other animals have very different views of the world than humans, especially with respect to which colors can be seen. Color is detected by cells in the eye called cones. Humans have three cones that are sensitive to three different ranges of electromagnetic wavelengths. They are called red, blue, and green cones, although these colors do not correspond exactly to the centers of the three ranges. The ranges of wavelengths that each cone detects are red, 500 to 700 nm; green, 450 to 630 nm; and blue, 400 to 500 nm. Most primates also have three kinds of cones and see the world much as we do. Most mammals other than primates only have two cones and have a less colorful view of things. Dogs, for example see blue and yellow, but are color blind to red and green. You might think that simpler species, such as fish and insects, would have less sophisticated vision, but this is not the case. Many birds, reptiles, amphibians, and insects have four or five different cones in their eyes. These species don’t have a wider range of perceived colors, but they see more hues, or combinations of colors. Also, some animals, such as bees or rattlesnakes, see a range of colors that is as broad as ours, but shifted into the ultraviolet or infrared. These differences in color perception are generally adaptations that help the animals survive. Colorful tropical birds and fish display some colors that are too subtle for us to see. These colors are believed to play a role in the species mating rituals. shows the colors visible and the color range of vision in humans, bees, and dogs. Humans, bees, and dogs see colors differently. Dogs see fewer colors than humans, and bees see a different range of colors. Teacher Support The symbiotic relationship between plants and their pollinators—bees, birds, etc.—is related to color perception. Plants have evolved to have flowers with colors that bees can see easily, and bees can find those flowers easily to collect the nectar they need for survival. The belief that bulls are enraged by seeing the color red is a misconception. What did you read in this Links to Physics that shows why this belief is incorrect? Bulls are color-blind to every color in the spectrum of colors. Bulls are color-blind to the blue colors in the spectrum of colors. Bulls are color-blind to the red colors in the spectrum of colors. Bulls are color-blind to the green colors in the spectrum of colors. Humans have found uses for every part of the electromagnetic spectrum. We will take a look at the uses of each range of frequencies, beginning with visible light. Most of our uses of visible light are obvious; without it our interaction with our surroundings would be much different. We might forget that nearly all of our food depends on the photosynthesis process in plants, and that the energy for this process comes from the visible part of the spectrum. Without photosynthesis, we would also have almost no oxygen in the atmosphere. Teacher Support [BL]Ask how different frequencies of EM radiation are applied. Name each frequency range, and ask the students to supply the application, for example, X-rays used in medical imaging. [OL]Ask students if they know why low-frequency radiation generally has different uses than high-frequency radiation. Explain that it has to do with penetrating power, which is related to health hazards. [AL]Mention the ranges of TV signals designated very high frequency (VHF) and ultrahigh frequency (UHF). Explain that these frequencies are only relatively high compared to radio broadcast frequencies. Their place in the whole EM spectrum is at the low end. The low-frequency, infrared region of the spectrum has many applications in media broadcasting. Television, radio, cell phone, and remote-control devices all broadcast and/or receive signals with these wavelengths. AM and FM radio signals are both low-frequency radiation. They are in different regions of the spectrum, but that is not their basic difference. AM and FM are abbreviations for amplitude modulation and frequency modulation. Information in AM signals has the form of changes in amplitude of the radio waves; information in FM signals has the form of changes in wave frequency. Another application of long-wavelength radiation is found in microwave ovens. These appliances cook or warm food by irradiating it with EM radiation in the microwave frequency range. Most kitchen microwaves use a frequency of 2.45× 10 9 Hz. These waves have the right amount of energy to cause polar molecules, such as water, to rotate faster. Polar molecules are those that have a partial charge separation. The rotational energy of these molecules is given up to surrounding matter as heat. The first microwave ovens were called Radaranges because they were based on radar technology developed during World War II. Radar uses radiation with wavelengths similar to those of microwaves to detect the location and speed of distant objects, such as airplanes, weather formations, and motor vehicles. Radar information is obtained by receiving and analyzing the echoes of microwaves reflected by an object. The speed of the object can be measured using the Doppler shift of the returning waves. This is the same effect you learned about when you studied sound waves. Like sound waves, EM waves are shifted to higher frequencies by an object moving toward an observer, and to lower frequencies by an object moving away from the observer. Astronomers use this same Doppler effect to measure the speed at which distant galaxies are moving away from us. In this case, the shift in frequency is called the red shift, because visible frequencies are shifted toward the lower-frequency, red end of the spectrum. Exposure to any radiation with frequencies greater than those of visible light carries some health hazards. All types of radiation in this range are known to cause cell damage. The danger is related to the high energy and penetrating ability of these EM waves. The likelihood of being harmed by any of this radiation depends largely on the amount of exposure. Most people try to reduce exposure to UV radiation from sunlight by using sunscreen and protective clothing. Physicians still use X-rays to diagnose medical problems, but the intensity of the radiation used is extremely low. shows an X-ray image of a patient’s chest cavity. One medical-imaging technique that involves no danger of exposure is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI is an important imaging and research tool in medicine, producing highly detailed two- and three-dimensional images. Radio waves are broadcast, absorbed, and reemitted in a resonance process that is sensitive to the density of nuclei, usually hydrogen nuclei—protons. This shadow X-ray image shows many interesting features, such as artificial heart valves, a pacemaker, and wires used to close the sternum. (credit: P.P.

Section Key Terms illuminance interference lumens luminous flux lux polarized light Teacher Support [BL]Impress on students how incredibly fast light travels. Start with 3.00 × 108 m/s and express it as 300,000 km/s, or roughly the distance to the moon or the odometer reading on an old, very durable car.[OL]Discuss fundamental physical constants. Ask students to name some others in addition to the speed of light. Supply the gravitational constant and Planck’s constant. Note that these are different from mathematical constants, such as pi. [AL]Explain that physical constants have the same value everywhere in the universe. This realization was an important event in the history of science. Both light and sound seem to travel very rapidly from a human perspective. Impress on students that the speed of sound is many orders of magnitude slower than the speed of light. Types of Electromagnetic Wave BehaviorIn a vacuum, all electromagnetic radiation travels at the same incredible speed of 3.00 × 108 m/s, which is equal to 671 million miles per hour. This is one of the fundamental physical constants. It is referred to as the speed of light and is given the symbol c. The space between celestial bodies is a near vacuum, so the light we see from the Sun, stars, and other planets has traveled here at the speed of light. Keep in mind that all EM radiation travels at this speed. All the different wavelengths of radiation that leave the Sun make the trip to Earth in the same amount of time. That trip takes 8.3 minutes. Light from the nearest star, besides the Sun, takes 4.2 years to reach Earth, and light from the nearest galaxy—a dwarf galaxy that orbits the Milky Way—travels 25,000 years on its way to Earth. You can see why we call very long distances astronomical. When light travels through a physical medium, its speed is always less than the speed of light. For example, light travels in water at three-fourths the value of c. In air, light has a speed that is just slightly slower than in empty space: 99.97 percent of c. Diamond slows light down to just 41 percent of c. When light changes speeds at a boundary between media, it also changes direction. The greater the difference in speeds, the more the path of light bends. In other chapters, we look at this bending, called refraction, in greater detail. We introduce refraction here to help explain a phenomenon called thin-film interference. Teacher Support [BL]Describe the rainbow colors that result from thin-film interference and ask students for examples. Fill in the ones they miss with soap bubbles, oil slicks, and compact discs. [OL]Describe refraction qualitatively. Base the discussion on change of speed; there is no need to introduce refractive index yet. Give some examples from everyday experience. For example, explain why objects underwater are not exactly where they appear to be. [AL]Explain refraction with the analogy of a four-wheeled vehicle veering from solid pavement into sand. When wheels on one side enter the sand—the slower medium—the vehicle swerves toward the sand. This is because the wheels on that side move more slowly than those on the pavement side. Have you ever wondered about the rainbow colors you often see on soap bubbles, oil slicks, and compact discs? This occurs when light is both refracted by and reflected from a very thin film. The diagram shows the path of light through such a thin film. The symbols n1, n2, and n3 indicate that light travels at different speeds in each of the three materials. Learn more about this topic in the chapter on diffraction and interference. shows the result of thin film interference on the surface of soap bubbles. Because ray 2 travels a greater distance, the two rays become out of phase. That is, the crests of the two emerging waves are no longer moving together. This causes interference, which reinforces the intensity of the wavelengths of light that create the bands of color. The color bands are separated because each color has a different wavelength. Also, the thickness of the film is not uniform, and different thicknesses cause colors of different wavelengths to interfere in different places. Note that the film must be very, very thin—somewhere in the vicinity of the wavelengths of visible light. Light striking a thin film is partially reflected (ray 1) and partially refracted at the top surface. The refracted ray is partially reflected at the bottom surface and emerges as ray 2. These rays will interfere in a way that depends on the thickness of the film and the indices of refraction of the various media. Teacher Support Do not confuse polar molecules with polarized light. If a molecule is polar, it refers to a separation of negative and positive electric charges. Polarized light is light whose electric field component vibrates in a specific plane. You have probably experienced how polarized sunglasses reduce glare from the surface of water or snow. The effect is caused by the wave nature of light. Looking back at , we see that the electric field moves in only one direction perpendicular to the direction of propagation. Light from most sources vibrates in all directions perpendicular to propagation. Light with an electric field that vibrates in only one direction is called polarized. A diagram of polarized light would look like . Polarized glasses are an example of a polarizing filter. These glasses absorb most of the horizontal light waves and transmit the vertical waves. This cuts down glare, which is caused by horizontal waves. shows how waves traveling along a rope can be used as a model of how a polarizing filter works. The oscillations in one rope are in a vertical plane and are said to be vertically polarized. Those in the other rope are in a horizontal plane and are horizontally polarized. If a vertical slit is placed on the first rope, the waves pass through. However, a vertical slit blocks the horizontally polarized waves. For EM waves, the direction of the electric field oscillation is analogous to the disturbances on the ropes. The transverse oscillations in one rope are in a vertical plane, and those in the other rope are in a horizontal plane. The first is said to be vertically polarized, and the other is said to be horizontally polarized. Vertical slits pass vertically polarized waves and block horizontally polarized waves. Light can also be polarized by reflection. Most of the light reflected from water, glass, or any highly reflective surface is polarized horizontally. shows the effect of a polarizing lens on light reflected from the surface of water. These two photographs of a river show the effect of a polarizing filter in reducing glare in light reflected from the surface of water. Part (b) of this figure was taken with a polarizing filter and part (a) was taken without. As a result, the reflection of clouds and sky observed in part (a) is not observed in part (b). Polarizing sunglasses are particularly useful on snow and water. Polarization of Light, Linear and Circular This video explains the polarization of light in great detail. Before viewing the video, look back at the drawing of an electromagnetic wave from the previous section. Try to visualize the two-dimensional drawing in three dimensions. How do polarized glasses reduce glare reflected from the ocean? They block horizontally polarized and vertically polarized light. They are transparent to horizontally polarized and vertically polarized light. They block horizontally polarized rays and are transparent to vertically polarized rays. They are transparent to horizontally polarized light and block vertically polarized light. Teacher Support The video explains how to generate linear polarized light, and how, by uniformly changing the phase of linear polarized light, circularly polarized light can be produced. Polarized Glasses EYE SAFETY—Looking at the Sun directly can cause permanent eye damage. Avoid looking directly at the Sun. two pairs of polarized sunglasses OR two lenses from one pair of polarized sunglasses Procedure Look through both or either polarized lens and record your observations. Hold the lenses, one in front of the other. Hold one lens stationary while you slowly rotate the other lens. Record your observations, including the relative angles of the lenses when you make each observation. Find a reflective surface on which the Sun is shining. It could be water, glass, a mirror, or any other similar smooth surface. The results will be more dramatic if the sunlight strikes the surface at a sharp angle. Observe the appearance of the surface with your naked eye and through one of the polarized lenses. Observe any changes as you slowly rotate the lens, and note the angles at which you see changes. Teacher Support Explain your observations made through the polarized lenses. Describe what happened when you held the lenses together and rotated one of them. Explain the changes during rotation in terms of planes of polarization. Explain your observation of the reflective surface in terms of planes of polarization. If you buy sunglasses in a store, how can you be sure that they are polarized? When one pair of sunglasses is placed in front of another and rotated in the plane of the body, the light passing through the sunglasses will be blocked at two positions due to refraction of light. When one pair of sunglasses is placed in front of another and rotated in the plane of the body, the light passing through the sunglasses will be blocked at two positions due to reflection of light. When one pair of sunglasses is placed in front of another and rotated in the plane of the body, the light passing through the sunglasses will be blocked at two positions due to the polarization of light. When one pair of sunglasses is placed in front of another and rotated in the plane of the body, the light passing through the sunglasses will be blocked at two positions due to the bending of light waves. Quantitative Treatment of Electromagnetic Waves Teacher Support [BL]Remember that the equation for speed is v = d/t, where v is velocity or speed, d is distance, and t is time. Rearrange the equation so that it can be used to solve for either distance or time if the other two values are known. [OL]Ask students to recall ****the metric units of frequency and wavelength. The answer is s −1 , or Hz for frequency and meters or any other metric distance unit for wavelength. A light year is a measure of distance, not time. We can use the speed of light, c, to carry out several simple but interesting calculations. If we know the distance to a celestial object, we can calculate how long it takes its light to reach us. Of course, we can also make the reverse calculation if we know the time it takes for the light to travel to us. For an object at a very great distance from Earth, it takes many years for its light to reach us. This means that we are looking at the object as it existed in the distant past. The object may, in fact, no longer exist. Very large distances in the universe are measured in light years. One light year is the distance that light travels in one year, which is 9.46× 10 12 kilometers or 5.88× 10 12 miles (…and 1012 is a trillion!). A useful equation involving c is c=fλ where f is frequency in Hz, and λ is wavelength in meters. Frequency and Wavelength Calculation For example, you can calculate the frequency of yellow light with a wavelength of 6.00× 10 −7 m. Strategy Rearrange the equation to solve for frequency. f= c λ Solution Substitute the values for the speed of light and wavelength into the equation. f= 3.00× 10 8 m/s 6.00× 10 −7 m =5.00× 10 14 s −1 =5.00× 10 14 Hz Discussion Manipulating exponents of 10 in a fraction can be tricky. Be sure you keep track of the + and – exponents correctly. Checking back to the diagram of the electromagnetic spectrum in the previous section shows that 1014 is a reasonable order of magnitude for the frequency of yellow light.The frequency of a wave is proportional to the energy the wave carries. The actual proportionality constant will be discussed in a later chapter. Since frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength, we also know that wavelength is inversely proportional to energy. Keep these relationships in mind as general rules. Teacher Support [BL]Good lighting for reading is important. We will see that moving twice as far away from a light source does not give you half as much light. It decreases much more than that. [AL]Recall the inverse-square law for gravitational force. Any force or radiation that spreads out in all directions will decrease with the square of the distance. The rate at which light is radiated from a source is called luminous flux, P, and it is measured in lumens (lm). Energy-saving light bulbs, which provide more luminous flux for a given use of electricity, are now available. One of these bulbs is called a compact fluorescent lamp; another is an LED (light-emitting diode) bulb. If you wanted to replace an old incandescent bulb with an energy saving bulb, you would want the new bulb to have the same brightness as the old one. To compare bulbs accurately, you would need to compare the lumens each one puts out. Comparing wattage—that is, the electric power used—would be misleading. Both wattage and lumens are stated on the packaging. The luminous flux of a bulb might be 2,000 lm. That accounts for all the light radiated in all directions. However, what we really need to know is how much light falls on an object, such as a book, at a specific distance. The number of lumens per square meter is called illuminance, and is given in units of lux (lx). Picture a light bulb in the middle of a sphere with a 1-m radius. The total surface of the sphere equals 4πr2 m2. The illuminance then is given by illuminance = P 4π r 2 . What happens if the radius of the sphere is increased 2 m? The illuminance is now only one-fourth as great, because the r2 term in the denominator is 4 instead of 1. shows how illuminance decreases with the inverse square of the distance. The diagram shows why the illuminance varies inversely with the square of the distance from a source of light. Calculating Illuminance A woman puts a new bulb in a floor lamp beside an easy chair. If the luminous flux of the bulb is rated at 2,000 lm, what is the illuminance on a book held 2.00 m from the bulb? Strategy Choose the equation and list the knowns. Equation: illuminance = P 4π r 2 P = 2,000 lm π = 3.14r = 2.00 m Solution Substitute the known values into the equation. illuminance = P 4π r 2 = 2,000 lm 4(3.14) (2.00) 2 m 2 = 39.8 lm/m 2 = 39.8 lx Discussion Try some other distances to illustrate how greatly light fades with distance from its source. For example, at 3 m the illuminance is only 17.7 lux. Parents often scold children for reading in light that is too dim. Instead of shouting, “You’ll ruin your eyes!” it might be better to explain the inverse square law of illuminance to the child. Practice Problems Red light has a wavelength of 7.0 × 10−7 m and a frequency of 4.3 × 1014 Hz. Use these values to calculate the speed of light in a vacuum. 3 × 1020 m/s 3 × 1015 m/s 3 × 1014 m/s 3 × 108 m/s Check Your Understanding Teacher Support Use these questions to assess student achievement of the section’s Learning Objectives. If students are struggling with a specific objective, these questions will help identify any gaps and direct students to the relevant content. Give an example of a place where light travels at the speed of 3.00 × 108 m/s. outer space water Earth’s atmosphere quartz glass Explain in terms of distances and the speed of light why it is currently very unlikely that humans will visit planets that circle stars other than our Sun. The spacecrafts used for travel are very heavy and thus very slow. Spacecrafts do not have a constant source of energy to run them. If a spacecraft could attain a maximum speed equal to that of light, it would still be too slow to cover astronomical distances. Spacecrafts can attain a maximum speed equal to that of light, but it is difficult to locate planets around stars. Section Summary EM radiation travels at different speeds in different media, produces colors on thin films, and can be polarized to oscillate in only one direction. Calculations can be based on the relationship among the speed, frequency, and wavelength of light, and on the relationship among luminous flux, illuminance, and distance. Key Equations frequency and wavelength c=fλ illuminance illuminance = P 4π r 2 Concept Items Light travels at different speeds in different media. Put these media in order, from the slowest light speed to the fastest light speed: air, diamond, vacuum, water. diamond, water, air, vacuum vacuum, diamond, air, water diamond, air, water, vacuum air, diamond, water, vacuum Bright sunlight is reflected from an icy pond. You look at the glare of the reflected light through polarized glasses. When you take the glasses off, rotate them 90°, and look through one of the lenses again, the light you see becomes brighter. Explain why the light you see changes. The glass blocks horizontally polarized light, and the light reflected from the icy pond is, in part, polarized horizontally. The glass blocks vertically polarized light, and the light reflected from the icy pond is, in part, polarized vertically. The glass allows horizontally polarized light to pass, and the light reflected from the icy pond is, in part, polarized vertically. The glass allows horizontally polarized light to pass, and the light reflected from the icy pond is, in part, polarized horizontally. Critical Thinking Explain how thin-film interference occurs. Discuss in terms of the meaning of interference and the pathways of light waves. For a particular thickness of film, light of a given wavelength that reflects from the outer and inner film surfaces is completely in phase, and so undergoes constructive interference. For a particular thickness of film, light of a given wavelength that reflects from the outer and inner surfaces is completely in phase, and so undergoes destructive interference. For a particular thickness of film, light of a given wavelength that reflects from the outer and inner film surfaces is completely out of phase, and so undergoes constructive interference. For a particular thickness of film, light of a given wavelength that reflects from the outer and inner film surfaces is completely out of phase, and so undergoes no interference. When you move a rope up and down, waves are created. If the waves pass through a slot, they will be affected differently, depending on the orientation of the slot. Using the rope waves and the slot as a model, explain how polarizing glasses affect light waves. If the wave—electric field—is vertical and slit—polarizing molecules in the glass—is horizontal, the wave will pass. If the wave—electric field— is vertical and slit—polarizing molecules in the glass—is vertical, the wave will not pass. If the wave—electric field—is horizontal and slit—polarizing molecules in the glass—is horizontal, the wave will pass. If the wave—electric field—is horizontal and slit—polarizing molecules in the glass—is horizontal, the wave will not pass. Problems Visible light has a range of wavelengths from about 400 nm to 800 nm . What is the range of frequencies for visible light? 3.75 × 106 Hz to 7.50 × 106 Hz 3.75 Hz to 7.50 Hz 3.75 × 10−7 Hz to 7.50 × 10−7 Hz 3.75 × 1014 Hz to 7.50 × 1014 Hz Light travels through the wall of a soap bubble that is 600 nm thick and is reflected from the inner surface back into the air. Assume the bubble wall is mostly water and that light travels in water at 75 percent of the speed of light in vacuum. How many seconds behind will the light reflected from the inner surface arrive compared to the light that was reflected from the outer surface? 4.0 × 10–8 s 5.3 × 10–6 s 2.65 × 10–15 s 5.3 × 10–15 s Performance Task Design an experiment to observe the phenomenon of thin-film interference. Observe colors of visible light, and relate each color to its corresponding wavelength. Comparison with the magnitudes of visible light wavelength will give an appreciation of just how very thin a thin film is. Thin-film interference has a number of practical applications, such as anti-reflection coatings and optical filters. Thin films used in filters can be designed to reflect or transmit specific wavelengths of light. This is done by depositing a film one molecular layer at a time from a vapor, thus allowing the thickness of the film to be exactly controlled.

They will begin to understand that light travels across space in straight lines and changes direction when it bounces off or passes through matter. The angles of these changes of direction can be calculated from equations that depend on the nature of the matter involved. These are the equations that are applied when engineers design microscopes and telescopes. They are also the equations that explain how the human eye works. [BL][OL] Review the idea that electromagnetic radiation (unlike sound waves) can travel across empty space as well as through some media. [AL] Throughout this chapter, light is represented as traveling in straight lines as long as it is traveling through a single medium or empty space. You may have heard that a prediction of Einstein’s relativity theory is that a strong gravitational field can bend the path of light. This hypothesis has been verified, but the effect is only significant in the case of light passing through a very large gravitational field, such as that close to our Sun. In the case of light paths studied in this chapter, this effect is insignificant. You have heard that light travels as waves. Do not think the path of light is wavy. The path is a straight line. The wave aspect refers to changes in the electric and magnetic fields that make up electromagnetic radiation. In another moment Alice was through the glass, and had jumped lightly down into the Looking-glass room.—Through the Looking Glass by Lewis CarolThrough the Looking Glass tells of the adventures of Alice after she steps from the real world, through a mirror, and into the virtual world. In this chapter we examine the optical meanings of real and virtual, as well as other concepts that make up the field of optics. The light from this page or screen is formed into an image by the lens of your eyes, much as the lens of the camera that made the photograph at the beginning of this chapter. Mirrors, like lenses, can also form images, which in turn are captured by your eyes. Optics is the branch of physics that deals with the behavior of visible light and other electromagnetic waves. For now, we concentrate on the propagation of light and its interaction with matter. It is convenient to divide optics into two major parts based on the size of objects that light encounters. When light interacts with an object that is several times as large as the light’s wavelength, its observable behavior is similar to a ray; it does not display its wave characteristics prominently. We call this part of optics geometric optics. This chapter focuses on situations for which geometric optics is suited.

Section Key Terms angle of incidence angle of reflection central axis concave mirror convex mirror diffused focal length focal point geometric optics law of reflection law of refraction ray real image specular virtual image Characteristics of Mirrors Teacher Support [BL]Recall that, in geometry, angles are numbers that tell how far two straight lines are spread apart. The lines must be straight lines for the number to have meaning. [OL]Geometry is the study of relationships involving points, lines, angles, and shapes. In this chapter, we are focused on the first three ideas. [AL]In this chapter, we apply equations that use trigonometric functions that describe the properties of angles. Trigonometric functions are ratios of the lengths of two sides of a right triangle. There are six possible ratios; therefore, there are six such functions. There are three ways, as shown in , in which light can travel from a source to another location. It can come directly from the source through empty space, such as from the Sun to Earth. Light can travel to an object through various media, such as air and glass. Light can also arrive at an object after being reflected, such as by a mirror. In all these cases, light is modeled as traveling in a straight line, called a ray. Light may change direction when it encounters the surface of a different material (such as a mirror) or when it passes from one material to another (such as when passing from air into glass). It then continues in a straight line—that is, as a ray. The word ray comes from mathematics. Here it means a straight line that originates from some point. It is acceptable to visualize light rays as laser rays (or even science fiction depictions of ray guns). Three methods for light to travel from a source to another location are shown. (a) Light reaches the upper atmosphere of Earth by traveling through empty space directly from the source (the Sun). (b) This light can reach a person in one of two ways. It can travel through a medium, such as air or glass, and typically travels from one medium to another. It can also reflect from an object, such as a mirror. Because light moves in straight lines, that is, as rays, and changes directions when it interacts with matter, it can be described through geometry and trigonometry. This part of optics, described by straight lines and angles, is therefore called geometric optics. There are two laws that govern how light changes direction when it interacts with matter: the law of reflection, for situations in which light bounces off matter; and the law of refraction, for situations in which light passes through matter. In this section, we consider the geometric optics of reflection. Teacher Support [BL]Explain that light bounces is a simplification. The geometry of the path of a bouncing ball is similar to that of light, but what happens at the point of impact is different at the molecular level. [OL]Indicate that the terms right angle, perpendicular, and normal line all mean the same thing: a vertical line at a 90° angle to a flat surface. [AL]Recount and explain all the possible interactions of light with matter. Light can be absorbed at the surface of an opaque object. Some colors of light may be absorbed and others reflected. Light often is partially absorbed and partially reflected. It may also be transmitted through a transparent material, such as water or glass. Typically, if the surface of a transparent material is smooth, such as that of a window pane, light is transmitted partially and reflected partially. Whenever we look into a mirror or squint at sunlight glinting from a lake, we are seeing a reflection. How does the reflected light travel from the object to your eyes? The law of reflection states: The angle of reflection, θ r , equals the angle of incidence, θ i . This law governs the behavior of all waves when they interact with a smooth surface, and therefore describe the behavior of light waves as well. The reflection of light is simplified when light is treated as a ray. This concept is illustrated in , which also shows how the angles are measured relative to the line perpendicular to the surface at the point where the light ray strikes it. This perpendicular line is also called the normal line, or just the normal. Light reflected in this way is referred to as specular (from the Latin word for mirror: speculum). We expect to see reflections from smooth surfaces, but , illustrates how a rough surface reflects light. Because the light is reflected from different parts of the surface at different angles, the rays go in many different directions, so the reflected light is diffused. Diffused light allows you to read a printed page from almost any angle because some of the rays go in different directions. Many objects, such as people, clothing, leaves, and walls, have rough surfaces and can be seen from many angles. A mirror, on the other hand, has a smooth surface and reflects light at specific angles. The law of reflection states that the angle of reflection, θr, equals the angle of incidence, θi. The angles are measured relative to the line perpendicular to the surface at the point where the ray strikes the surface. The incident and reflected rays, along with the normal, lie in the same plane. Light is diffused when it reflects from a rough surface. Here, many parallel rays are incident, but they are reflected at many different angles because the surface is rough. When we see ourselves in a mirror, it appears that our image is actually behind the mirror. We see the light coming from a direction determined by the law of reflection. The angles are such that our image is exactly the same distance behind the mirror, di, as the distance we stand away from the mirror, do. Although these mirror images make objects appear to be where they cannot be (such as behind a solid wall), the images are not figments of our imagination. Mirror images can be photographed and videotaped by instruments and look just as they do to our eyes, which are themselves optical instruments. An image in a mirror is said to be a virtual image, as opposed to a real image. A virtual image is formed when light rays appear to diverge from a point without actually doing so. helps illustrate how a flat mirror forms an image. Two rays are shown emerging from the same point, striking the mirror, and reflecting into the observer’s eye. The rays can diverge slightly, and both still enter the eye. If the rays are extrapolated backward, they seem to originate from a common point behind the mirror, allowing us to locate the image. The paths of the reflected rays into the eye are the same as if they had come directly from that point behind the mirror. Using the law of reflection—the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence—we can see that the image and object are the same distance from the mirror. This is a virtual image, as defined earlier. When two sets of rays from common points on an object are reflected by a flat mirror into the eye of an observer, the reflected rays seem to originate from behind the mirror, which determines the position of the virtual image. Mirror Mazes is a chase scene from an old silent film called The Circus, starring Charlie Chaplin. The chase scene takes place in a mirror maze. You may have seen such a maze at an amusement park or carnival. Finding your way through the maze can be very difficult. Keep in mind that only one image in the picture is real—the others are virtual. Charlie Chaplin is in a mirror maze. Which image is real? One of the earliest uses of mirrors for creating the illusion of space is seen in the Palace of Versailles, the former home of French royalty. Construction of the Hall of Mirrors () began in 1678. It is still one of the most popular tourist attractions at Versailles. Tourists love to wander in the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles. (credit: Michal Osmenda, Flickr) Only one Charlie in this image () is real. The others are all virtual images of him. Can you tell which is real? Hint—His hat is tilted to one side. The virtual images have their hats tilted to the right. The virtual images have their hats tilted to the left. The real images have their hats tilted to the right. The real images have their hats tilted to the left. Virtual Image This video explains the creation of virtual images in a mirror. It shows the location and orientation of the images using ray diagrams, and relates the perception to the human eye. Teacher Support Have students construct a ray diagram for an object reflected in a plane mirror. Point out to them that all information can be represented in the diagram by using just paper, a pencil, a ruler, and a protractor. Students may use the preceding video and to help them to draw the necessary rays for the diagram. Have them compare the position and orientation of the virtual image with that of the object, paying particular attention to the identical distances that the object and image have with respect to the mirror surface. Teacher Support [BL]Ask students to define virtual and dispel any misconceptions. Explain the term in relation to geometric optics. [OL]Explain that a real focal point is a point at which there is a concentration of light energy that can be transformed into other useful forms. At a virtual focal point, on the other hand, light energy cannot be concentrated because no light actually goes to that point. [AL]Explain the difference between a parabolic shape and a spherical shape. Use drawings of a cross-section of each. Point out that, for a short section of a curved mirror with very little curvature, a spherical mirror approximates a parabolic one. Some mirrors are curved instead of flat. A mirror that curves inward is called a concave mirror, whereas one that curves outward is called a convex mirror. Pick up a well-polished metal spoon and you can see an example of each type of curvature. The side of the spoon that holds the food is a concave mirror; the back of the spoon is a convex mirror. Observe your image on both sides of the spoon. You can remember the difference between concave and convex by thinking, Concave means caved in. Ray diagrams can be used to find the point where reflected rays converge or appear to converge, or the point from which rays appear to diverge. This is called the focal point, F. The distance from F to the mirror along the central axis (the line perpendicular to the center of the mirror’s surface) is called the focal length, f. shows the focal points of concave and convex mirrors. (a, b) The focal length for the concave mirror in (a), formed by converging rays, is in front of the mirror, and has a positive value. The focal length for the convex mirror in (b), formed by diverging rays, appears to be behind the mirror, and has a negative value.Images formed by a concave mirror vary, depending on which side of the focal point the object is placed. For any object placed on the far side of the focal point with respect to the mirror, the rays converge in front of the mirror to form a real image, which can be projected onto a surface, such as a screen or sheet of paper However, for an object located inside the focal point with respect to the concave mirror, the image is virtual. For a convex mirror the image is always virtual—that is, it appears to be behind the mirror. The ray diagrams in show how to determine the nature of the image formed by concave and convex mirrors. (a) The image of an object placed outside the focal point of a concave mirror is inverted and real. (b) The image of an object placed inside the focal point of a concave mirror is erect and virtual. (c) The image of an object formed by a convex mirror is erect and virtual. The information in is summarized in . Curved Mirror Images Type of Mirror Object to Mirror Distance, do Image Characteristics Concave d o >f Real and inverted Concave d o <f Virtual and erect Convex d o < or > f Virtual and erect This table details the type and orientation of images formed by concave and convex mirrors. Concave and Convex Mirrors Silver spoon and silver polish, or a new spoon made of any shiny metal Instructions Procedure Choose any small object with a top and a bottom, such as a short nail or tack, or a coin, such as a quarter. Observe the object’s reflection on the back of the spoon. Observe the reflection of the object on the front (bowl side) of the spoon when held away from the spoon at a distance of several inches. Observe the image while slowly moving the small object toward the bowl of the spoon. Continue until the object is all the way inside the bowl of the spoon. You should see one point where the object disappears and then reappears. This is the focal point. Teacher Support Describe the differences in the image of the object on the two sides of the focal point. Explain the change. Identify which of the images you saw were real and which were virtual. Teacher Support [BL][OL]Ask students to identify as many examples as they can of curved mirrors that are used in everyday applications. Supply any they miss: security mirrors, mirrors for entering and exiting a driveway with poor visibility, rear-view mirrors, mirrors for application of cosmetics, and so on. Parabolic Mirrors and Real Images This video uses ray diagrams to show the special feature of parabolic mirrors that makes them ideal for either projecting light energy in parallel rays, with the source being at the focal point of the parabola, or for collecting at the focal point light energy from a distant source. Teacher Support Have students use the demonstration in the video to construct a ray diagram that shows that rays from an object (upright arrow) placed at the focal point of a concave mirror emerge parallel to the central axis. You should be able to notice everyday applications of curved mirrors. One common example is the use of security mirrors in stores, as shown in . Security mirrors are convex, producing a smaller, upright image. Because the image is smaller, a larger area is imaged compared with what would be observed for a flat mirror; hence, security is improved. (credit: Laura D’Alessandro, Flickr) Some telescopes also use curved mirrors and no lenses (except in the eyepieces) both to magnify images and to change the path of light. shows a Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope. This design uses a spherical primary concave mirror and a convex secondary mirror. The image is projected onto the focal plane by light passing through the perforated primary mirror. The effective focal length of such a telescope is the focal length of the primary mirror multiplied by the magnification of the secondary mirror. The result is a telescope with a focal length much greater than the length of the telescope itself. This diagram shows the design of a Schmidt–Cassegrain telescope. A parabolic concave mirror has the very useful property that all light from a distant source, on reflection by the mirror surface, is directed to the focal point. Likewise, a light source placed at the focal point directs all the light it emits in parallel lines away from the mirror. This case is illustrated by the ray diagram in . The light source in a car headlight, for example, is located at the focal point of a parabolic mirror. The bulb in this ray diagram of a car headlight is located at the focal point of a parabolic mirror. Parabolic mirrors are also used to collect sunlight and direct it to a focal point, where it is transformed into heat, which in turn can be used to generate electricity. This application is shown in . Parabolic trough collectors are used to generate electricity in southern California.

[AL]Demonstrate how to solve equations of the type 1 a = 1 b + 1 c for any of the variables in terms of the other two. Rearrange so that the variable solved for is not a reciprocal. Curved mirrors and the images they create involve a fairly small number of variables: the mirror’s radius of curvature, R; the focal length, f; the distances of the object and image from the mirror, do and di, respectively; and the heights of the object and image, ho and hi, respectively. The signs of these values indicate whether the image is inverted, erect (upright), real, or virtual. We now look at the equations that relate these variables and apply them to everyday problems. shows the meanings of most of the variables we will use for calculations involving curved mirrors. Look for the variables, do, di, ho, hi, and f in this figure. The basic equation that describes both lenses and mirrors is the lens/mirror equation 1 f = 1 d i + 1 d o . This equation can be rearranged several ways. For example, it may be written to solve for focal length. f= d i d o d o + d i Magnification, m, is the ratio of the size of the image, hi, to the size of the object, ho. The value of m can be calculated in two ways. m= h i h o = − d i d o This relationship can be written to solve for any of the variables involved. For example, the height of the image is given by h i =− h o ( d i d o ). We saved the simplest equation for last. The radius of curvature of a curved mirror, R, is simply twice the focal length. R=2f We can learn important information from the algebraic sign of the result of a calculation using the previous equations: A negative di indicates a virtual image; a positive value indicates a real image A negative hi indicates an inverted image; a positive value indicates an erect image For concave mirrors, f is positive; for convex mirrors, f is negative Now let’s apply these equations to solve some problems. Calculating Focal Length A person standing 6.0 m from a convex security mirror forms a virtual image that appears to be 1.0 m behind the mirror. What is the focal length of the mirror? Strategy The person is the object, so do = 6.0 m. We know that, for this situation, do is positive. The image is virtual, so the value for the image distance is negative, so di = –1.0 m. Now, use the appropriate version of the lens/mirror equation to solve for focal length by substituting the known values. Solution f= d i d o d o + d i = (−1.0)(6.0) 6.0+(−1.0) = −6.0 5.0 =−1.2 m Discussion The negative result is expected for a convex mirror. This indicates the focal point is behind the mirror. Calculating Object Distance Electric room heaters use a concave mirror to reflect infrared (IR) radiation from hot coils. Note that IR radiation follows the same law of reflection as visible light. Given that the mirror has a radius of curvature of 50.0 cm and produces an image of the coils 3.00 m in front of the mirror, where are the coils with respect to the mirror? Strategy We are told that the concave mirror projects a real image of the coils at an image distance di = 3.00 m. The coils are the object, and we are asked to find their location—that is, to find the object distance do. We are also given the radius of curvature of the mirror, so that its focal length is f = R/2 = 25.0 cm (a positive value, because the mirror is concave, or converging). We can use the lens/mirror equation to solve this problem. Solution Because di and f are known, the lens/mirror equation can be used to find do. 1 f = 1 d i + 1 d o Rearranging to solve for do, we have d o = d i f d i −f . Entering the known quantities gives us d o = (3.00× 10 2 )(25.0) (3.00× 10 2 )−25.0 =27.3 cm. Discussion Note that the object (the coil filament) is farther from the mirror than the mirror’s focal length. This is a case 1 image (do > f and f positive), consistent with the fact that a real image is formed. You get the most concentrated thermal energy directly in front of the mirror and 3.00 m away from it. In general, this is not desirable because it could cause burns. Usually, you want the rays to emerge parallel, and this is accomplished by having the filament at the focal point of the mirror. Note that the filament here is not much farther from the mirror than the focal length, and that the image produced is considerably farther away. Practice Problems What is the focal length of a makeup mirror that produces a magnification of 1.50 when a person’s face is 12.0 cm away? Construct a ray diagram using paper, a pencil and a ruler to confirm your calculation. –36.0 cm –7.20 cm 7.20 cm 36.0 cm Check Your Understanding Teacher Support Use these questions to assess student achievement of the section’s learning objectives. If students are struggling with a specific objective, these questions will help identify which one, and then you can direct students to the relevant content. How does the object distance, do, compare with the focal length, f, for a concave mirror that produces an image that is real and inverted? do > f, where do and f are object distance and focal length, respectively. do < f, where do and f are object distance and focal length, respectively. do = f, where do and f are object distance and focal length, respectively. do = 0, where do is the object distance. Section Summary The angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence. Plane mirrors and convex mirrors reflect virtual, erect images. Concave mirrors reflect light to form real, inverted images or virtual, erect images, depending on the location of the object. Image distance, height, and other characteristics can be calculated using the lens/mirror equation and the magnification equation.

Section Key Terms angle of refraction corner reflector critical angle dispersion incident ray index of refraction refracted ray Snell’s law total internal reflection The Law of Refraction Teacher Support [BL][OL]Remind students that the maximum speed of light is its speed in a vacuum. This is a fundamental constant of physics. The maximum speed of light is equal to 3.00 × 108 m/s. Have your students memorize this value. You may have noticed some odd optical phenomena when looking into a fish tank. For example, you may see the same fish appear to be in two different places (). This is because light coming to you from the fish changes direction when it leaves the tank and, in this case, light rays traveling along two different paths both reach our eyes. The changing of a light ray’s direction (loosely called bending) when it passes a boundary between materials of different composition, or between layers in single material where there are changes in temperature and density, is called refraction. Refraction is responsible for a tremendous range of optical phenomena, from the action of lenses to voice transmission through optical fibers. Looking at the fish tank as shown, we can see the same fish in two different locations, because light changes directions when it passes from water to air. In this case, light rays traveling on two different paths change direction as they travel from water to air, and so reach the observer. Consequently, the fish appears to be in two different places. This bending of light is called refraction and is responsible for many optical phenomena. Teacher Support [BL]An angle is the measure of the separation of two lines or rays originating from a single point. The length of the lines is not relevant. [OL][AL]The trigonometric function sine (sin) for a given angle is the ratio of the side of a right triangle opposite that angle to the hypotenuse of that triangle. Why does light change direction when passing from one material (medium) to another? It is because light changes speed when going from one material to another. This behavior is typical of all waves and is especially easy to apply to light because light waves have very small wavelengths, and so they can be treated as rays. Before we study the law of refraction, it is useful to discuss the speed of light and how it varies between different media. The speed of light is now known to great precision. In fact, the speed of light in a vacuum, c, is so important, and is so precisely known, that it is accepted as one of the basic physical quantities, and has the fixed value c=2.9972458× 10 8 m/s≈3.00× 10 8 m/s where the approximate value of 3.00 × 108 m/s is used whenever three-digit precision is sufficient. The speed of light through matter is less than it is in a vacuum, because light interacts with atoms in a material. The speed of light depends strongly on the type of material, given that its interaction with different atoms, crystal lattices, and other substructures varies. We define the index of refraction, n, of a material to be n= c v , where v is the observed speed of light in the material. Because the speed of light is always less than c in matter and equals c only in a vacuum, the index of refraction (plural: indices of refraction) is always greater than or equal to one. lists the indices of refraction in various common materials. Indices of Refraction Medium n Gases at 0 °C and 1 atm Air 1.000293 Carbon dioxide 1.00045 Hydrogen 1.000139 Oxygen 1.000271 Liquids at 20 °C Benzene 1.501 Carbon disulfide 1.628 Carbon tetrachloride 1.461 Ethanol 1.361 Glycerin 1.473 Water, fresh 1.333 Solids at 20 °C Diamond 2.419 Fluorite 1.434 Glass, crown 1.52 Glass, flint 1.66 Ice at 0 °C 1.309 Plexiglas 1.51 Polystyrene 1.49 Quartz, crystalline 1.544 Quartz, fused 1.458 Sodium chloride 1.544 Zircon 1.923 The table lists the indices of refraction for various materials that are transparent to light. Note, that light travels the slowest in the materials with the greatest indices of refraction. provides an analogy for and a description of how a ray of light changes direction when it passes from one medium to another. As in the previous section, the angles are measured relative to a perpendicular to the surface at the point where the light ray crosses it. The change in direction of the light ray depends on how the speed of light changes. The change in the speed of light is related to the indices of refraction of the media involved. In the situations shown in , medium 2 has a greater index of refraction than medium 1. This difference in index of refraction means that the speed of light is less in medium 2 than in medium 1. Note that, in (a), the path of the ray moves closer to the perpendicular when the ray slows down. Conversely, in (b), the path of the ray moves away from the perpendicular when the ray speeds up. The path is exactly reversible. In both cases, you can imagine what happens by thinking about pushing a lawn mower from a footpath onto grass, and vice versa. Going from the footpath to grass, the right front wheel is slowed and pulled to the side as shown. This is the same change in direction for light when it goes from a fast medium to a slow one. When going from the grass to the footpath, the left front wheel moves faster than the others, and the mower changes direction as shown. This, too, is the same change in direction as light going from slow to fast. The change in direction of a light ray depends on how the speed of light changes when it crosses from one medium to another. For the situations shown here, the speed of light is greater in medium 1 than in medium 2. (a) A ray of light moves closer to the perpendicular when it slows down. This is analogous to what happens when a lawnmower goes from a footpath (medium 1) to grass (medium 2). (b) A ray of light moves away from the perpendicular when it speeds up. This is analogous to what happens when a lawnmower goes from grass (medium 2) to the footpath (medium 1). The paths are exactly reversible. Bent Pencil A classic observation of refraction occurs when a pencil is placed in a glass filled halfway with water. Do this and observe the shape of the pencil when you look at it sideways through air, glass, and water. A full-length pencil A glass half full of water Instructions Procedure Place the pencil in the glass of water. Observe the pencil from the side. Explain your observations. Teacher Support Look up the refractive indices of air, glass, and water in . Think about how a ray of light changes direction for these transitions: air to glass and glass to water. Bending Light The Bending Light simulation allows you to show light refracting as it crosses the boundaries between various media (download animation first to view). It also shows the reflected ray. You can move the protractor to the point where the light meets the boundary and measure the angle of incidence, the angle of refraction, and the angle of reflection. You can also insert a prism into the beam to view the spreading, or dispersion, of white light into colors, as discussed later in this section. Use the ray option at the upper left. Teacher Support Have students try all the different tabs at the top of the simulation. Point out to students that, although the tools work in both Ray and Wave mode, some may be easier to use in Wave mode because the region where the tool is able to read is larger. Teacher Support [BL]Be sure students understand that if c is always greater than v, n must always be greater than one. Demonstrating division using numbers that can be divided easily can reinforce student understanding. [OL]Explain that, unlike the law of reflection, the law of refraction is most easily expressed as an equation, rather than in words. Walk students through the lawnmower analogy in . Suggest other wheeled vehicles with which they may be more familiar, and other surfaces, such as sand. [AL]Ask students to try to explain why a prism separates white light into a rainbow of colors, but a window pane does not. If they cannot explain it, show them a ray diagram of light transmitted through a flat sheet of glass. The amount that a light ray changes direction depends both on the incident angle and the amount that the speed changes. For a ray at a given incident angle, a large change in speed causes a large change in direction, and thus a large change in the angle of refraction. The exact mathematical relationship is the law of refraction, or Snell’s law, which is stated in equation form as n 1 sin θ 1 = n 2 sin θ 2 or n 1 n 2 = sin θ 2 sin θ 1 . In terms of speeds, Snell’s law becomes sin θ 1 sin θ 2 = v 1 v 2 . Here, n1 and n2 are the indices of refraction for media 1 and 2, respectively, and θ1 and θ2 are the angles between the rays and the perpendicular in the respective media 1 and 2, as shown in . The incoming ray is called the incident ray and the outgoing ray is called the refracted ray. The associated angles are called the angle of incidence and the angle of refraction. Later, we apply Snell’s law to some practical situations. Dispersion is defined as the spreading of white light into the wavelengths of which it is composed. This happens because the index of refraction varies slightly with wavelength. shows how a prism disperses white light into the colors of the rainbow. (a) A pure wavelength of light ( λ ) falls onto a prism and is refracted at both surfaces. (b) White light is dispersed by the prism (spread of light exaggerated). Because the index of refraction varies with wavelength, the angles of refraction vary with wavelength. A sequence of red to violet is produced, because the index of refraction increases steadily with decreasing wavelength. Rainbows are produced by a combination of refraction and reflection. You may have noticed that you see a rainbow only when you turn your back to the Sun. Light enters a drop of water and is reflected from the back of the drop, as shown in . The light is refracted both as it enters and as it leaves the drop. Because the index of refraction of water varies with wavelength, the light is dispersed and a rainbow is observed. Part of the light falling on this water drop enters and is reflected from the back of the drop. This light is refracted and dispersed both as it enters and as it leaves the drop. Dispersion This video explains how refraction disperses white light into its composite colors. Teacher Support Have students note that the dependence of the index of refraction on the speed of light implies a dependence on wavelength, as discussed in the video. This is because v=fλ for light in a medium. Different wavelengths of light travel at different speeds, and so refract differently at media boundaries. Also, have students note that the frequency of light is not affected by refraction; it remains constant. A good-quality mirror reflects more than 90 percent of the light that falls on it; the mirror absorbs the rest. But, it would be useful to have a mirror that reflects all the light that falls on it. Interestingly, we can produce total reflection using an aspect of refraction. Consider what happens when a ray of light strikes the surface between two materials, such as is shown in (a). Part of the light crosses the boundary and is refracted; the rest is reflected. If, as shown in the figure, the index of refraction for the second medium is less than the first, the ray bends away from the perpendicular. Because n1 > n2, the angle of refraction is greater than the angle of incidence—that is, θ 2 > θ 1 . Now, imagine what happens as the incident angle is increased. This causes θ 2 to increase as well. The largest the angle of refraction, θ 2 , can be is 90°, as shown in (b). The critical angle, θ c , for a combination of two materials is defined to be the incident angle, θ 1 , which produces an angle of refraction of 90°. That is, θ c is the incident angle for which θ 2 = 90°. If the incident angle, θ 1 , is greater than the critical angle, as shown in (c), then all the light is reflected back into medium 1, a condition called total internal reflection. (a) A ray of light crosses a boundary where the speed of light increases and the index of refraction decreases—that is, n2 < n1. The refracted ray bends away from the perpendicular. (b) The critical angle, θ c , is the one for which the angle of refraction is 90°. (c) Total internal reflection occurs when the incident angle is greater than the critical angle. Recall that Snell’s law states the relationship between angles and indices of refraction. It is given by n 1 sin θ 1 = n 2 sin θ 2 . When the incident angle equals the critical angle ( θ 1 = θ c ), the angle of refraction is 90° ( θ 2 = 90°). Noting that sin 90° = 1, Snell’s law in this case becomes n 1 sin θ 1 = n 2 . The critical angle, θ c , for a given combination of materials is thus θ c = sin −1 ( n 2 n 1 ), for n1 > n2. Teacher Support [OL]The superscript in sin−1 is not a power. It indicates arcsine, which is an inverse trigonometric function. It means, “that angle whose sine equals (in this case) (n2/n1).” Total internal reflection occurs for any incident angle greater than the critical angle, θ c , and it can only occur when the second medium has an index of refraction less than the first. Note that the previous equation is written for a light ray that travels in medium 1 and reflects from medium 2, as shown in . There are several important applications of total internal reflection. Total internal reflection, coupled with a large index of refraction, explains why diamonds sparkle more than other materials. The critical angle for a diamond-to-air surface is only 24.4°; so, when light enters a diamond, it has trouble getting back out (). Although light freely enters the diamond at different angles, it can exit only if it makes an angle less than 24.4° with the normal to a given surface. Facets on diamonds are specifically intended to make this unlikely, so that the light can exit only in certain places. Diamonds with very few impurities are very clear, so the light makes many internal reflections and is concentrated at the few places it can exit—hence the sparkle. Light cannot escape a diamond easily because its critical angle with air is so small. Most reflections are total and the facets are placed so that light can exit only in particular ways, thus concentrating the light and making the diamond sparkle. A light ray that strikes an object that consists of two mutually perpendicular reflecting surfaces is reflected back exactly parallel to the direction from which it came. This parallel reflection is true whenever the reflecting surfaces are perpendicular, and it is independent of the angle of incidence. Such an object is called a corner reflector because the light bounces from its inside corner. Many inexpensive reflector buttons on bicycles, cars, and warning signs have corner reflectors designed to return light in the direction from which it originates. Corner reflectors are perfectly efficient when the conditions for total internal reflection are satisfied. With common materials, it is easy to obtain a critical angle that is less than 45°. One use of these perfect mirrors is in binoculars, as shown in . Another application is for periscopes used in submarines. These binoculars use corner reflectors with total internal reflection to get light to the observer’s eyes. Fiber optics are one common application of total internal reflection. In communications, fiber optics are used to transmit telephone, internet, and cable TV signals, and they use the transmission of light down fibers of plastic or glass. Because the fibers are thin, light entering one is likely to strike the inside surface at an angle greater than the critical angle and, thus, be totally reflected (). The index of refraction outside the fiber must be smaller than inside, a condition that is satisfied easily by coating the outside of the fiber with a material that has an appropriate refractive index. In fact, most fibers have a varying refractive index to allow more light to be guided along the fiber through total internal reflection. Rays are reflected around corners as shown in the figure, making the fibers into tiny light pipes. (a) Fibers in bundles are clad by a material that has a lower index of refraction than the core to ensure total internal reflection, even when fibers are in contact with one another. A single fiber with its cladding is shown. (b) Light entering a thin fiber may strike the inside surface at large, or grazing, angles, and is completely reflected if these angles exceed the critical angle. Such rays continue down the fiber, even following it around corners, because the angles of reflection and incidence remain large. Medicine: Endoscopes A medical device called an endoscope is shown in . Endoscopes, such as the one drawn here, send light down a flexible fiber optic tube, which sends images back to a doctor in charge of performing a medical procedure. The word endoscope means looking inside. Doctors use endoscopes to look inside hollow organs in the human body and inside body cavities. These devices are used to diagnose internal physical problems. Images may be transmitted to an eyepiece or sent to a video screen. Another channel is sometimes included to allow the use of small surgical instruments. Such surgical procedures include collecting biopsies for later testing, and removing polyps and other growths. Calculations with the Law of Refraction Teacher Support [BL]If an equation has two variables and a constant, such as n=c/v, the value of only one variable is needed to find the other. [OL]Explain the difference between sine and arcsine. Explain why sin 90° = 1. Note that the index of refraction is a dimensionless number. [AL]Show why the values sin 0°, sin 30°, sin 45°, sin 60°, and sin 90° can be expressed in the form 1 2 0 , 1 2 1 , 1 2 2 , 1 2 3 , 1 2 4 . Show that the numerical values of these expressions are 0, 0.5, 0.707, 0.866, and 1.00, respectively. The calculation problems that follow require application of the following equations: n= c v , n 1 sin θ 1 = n 2 sin θ 2 or n 1 n 2 = sin θ 2 sin θ 1 , and θ c = sin −1 ( n 2 n 1 ), for n 1 > n 2 . These are the equations for refractive index, the mathematical statement of the law of refraction (Snell’s law), and the equation for the critical angle. Snell’s Law Example 1 This video leads you through calculations based on the application of the equation that represents Snell’s law. Calculating Index of Refraction from Speed Calculate the index of refraction for a solid medium in which the speed of light is 2.012 × 108 m/s, and identify the most likely substance, based on the previous table of indicies of refraction.Strategy We know the speed of light, c, is 3.00 × 108 m/s, and we are given v. We can simply plug these values into the equation for index of refraction, n. Solution n= c v = 3.00× 10 8 m/s 2.012× 10 8 m/s =1.49 This value matches that of polystyrene exactly, according to the table of indices of refraction (). Discussion The three-digit approximation for c is used, which in this case is all that is needed. Many values in the table are only given to three significant figures. Note that the units for speed cancel to yield a dimensionless answer, which is correct. Calculating Index of Refraction from Angles Suppose you have an unknown, clear solid substance immersed in water and you wish to identify it by finding its index of refraction. You arrange to have a beam of light enter it at an angle of 45.00°, and you observe the angle of refraction to be 40.30°. What are the index of refraction of the substance and its likely identity? Strategy We must use the mathematical expression for the law of refraction to solve this problem because we are given angle data, not speed data. n 1 n 2 = sin θ 2 sin θ 1 The subscripts 1 and 2 refer to values for water and the unknown, respectively, where 1 represents the medium from which the light is coming and 2 is the new medium it is entering. We are given the angle values, and the table of indicies of refraction gives us n for water as 1.333. All we have to do before solving the problem is rearrange the equation n 2 = n 1 sin θ 1 sin θ 2 . Solution n 2 = (1.333)(0.7071) 0.6468 =1.457 The best match from is fused quartz, with n = 1.458. Discussion Note the relative sizes of the variables involved. For example, a larger angle has a larger sine value. This checks out for the two angles involved. Note that the smaller value of θ 2 compared with θ 1 indicates the ray has bent toward normal. This result is to be expected if the unknown substance has a greater n value than that of water. The result shows that this is the case. Calculating Critical Angle Verify that the critical angle for light going from water to air is 48.6°. (See , the table of indices of refraction.)Strategy First, choose the equation for critical angle θ c = sin −1 ( n 2 n 1 ), for n 1 > n 2 . Then, look up the n values for water, n1, and air, n2. Find the value of n 2 n 1 . Last, find the angle that has a sine equal to this value and it compare with the given angle of 48.6°. Solution For water, n1 = 1.333; for air, n2 = 1.0003. So, n 2 n 1 = 1.0003 1.333 =0.7504 sin −1 (0.7504)=48.63°. Discussion Remember, when we try to find a critical angle, we look for the angle at which light can no longer escape past a medium boundary by refraction. It is logical, then, to think of subscript 1 as referring to the medium the light is trying to leave, and subscript 2 as where it is trying (unsuccessfully) to go. So water is 1 and air is 2. Practice Problems The refractive index of ethanol is 1.36.

If students are struggling with a specific objective, these questions help identify which one, and then you can direct students to the relevant content. Section Summary The index of refraction for a material is given by the speed of light in a vacuum divided by the speed of light in that material. Snell’s law states the relationship between indices of refraction, the incident angle, and the angle of refraction.

Test Prep Short Answer Water floats on a liquid called carbon tetrachloride. The two liquids do not mix. A light ray passing from water into carbon tetrachloride has an incident angle of 45.0° and an angle of refraction of 40.1°. If the index of refraction of water is 1.33, what is the index of refraction of carbon tetrachloride? 1.60 1.49 1.21 1.46 Describe what happens to a light ray when it is refracted. Include in your explanation comparison of angles, comparison of refractive indices, and the term normal. When a ray of light goes from one medium to another medium with a different refractive index, the ray changes its path as a result of interference. The angle between the ray and the normal (the line perpendicular to the surfaces of the two media) is greater in the medium with the greater refractive index. When a ray of light goes from one medium to another medium with a different refractive index, the ray changes its path as a result of refraction. The angle between the ray and the normal (the line perpendicular to the surfaces of the two media) is less in the medium with the greater refractive index. When a ray of light goes from one medium to another medium with a different refractive index, the ray does not change its path. The angle between the ray and the normal (the line parallel to the surfaces of the two media) is the same in both media. When a ray of light goes from one medium to another medium with a different refractive index, the ray changes its path as a result of refraction. The angle between the ray and the normal (the line perpendicular to the surfaces of the two media) is less in the medium with the lower refractive index. Test Prep Extended Response A scuba diver training in a pool looks at his instructor, as shown in this figure. The angle between the ray in the water and the normal to the water is 25°.

Assume n = 1.00 for air. 68° 25° 19° 34° Describe total internal reflection. Include a definition of the critical angle and how it is related to total internal reflection. Also, compare the indices of refraction of the interior material and the surrounding material. When the interior material has a smaller index of refraction than the surrounding material, the incident ray may approach the boundary at an angle (called the critical angle) such that the refraction angle is 90° . The refracted ray cannot leave the interior, so it is reflected back inside and total internal reflection occurs. When the interior material has a smaller index of refraction than the surrounding material, the incident ray may approach the boundary at an angle (called the critical angle) such that the refraction angle is less than 90° . The refracted ray cannot leave the interior, so it is reflected back inside and total internal reflection occurs. When the interior material has the same index of refraction as the surrounding material, the incident ray approaches the boundary at an angle (called the critical angle) such that the refraction angle is less than 90° . The refracted ray cannot leave the interior, so it is reflected back inside and total internal reflection occurs. When the interior material has a greater index of refraction than the surrounding material, the incident ray may approach the boundary at an angle (called the critical angle) such that the refraction angle is 90° .

Review the terms focal point, focal length, object distance, image distance, concave, convex, converging, and diverging from the Reflection section. Lenses are found in a huge array of optical instruments, ranging from a simple magnifying glass to the eye to a camera’s zoom lens. In this section, we use the law of refraction to explore the properties of lenses and how they form images. Some of what we learned in the earlier discussion of curved mirrors also applies to the study of lenses. Concave, convex, focal point F, and focal length f have the same meanings as before, except each measurement is made from the center of the lens instead of the surface of the mirror. The convex lens shown in has been shaped so that all light rays that enter it parallel to its central axis cross one another at a single point on the opposite side of the lens. The central axis, or axis, is defined to be a line normal to the lens at its center. Such a lens is called a converging lens because of the converging effect it has on light rays. An expanded view of the path of one ray through the lens is shown in to illustrate how the ray changes direction both as it enters and as it leaves the lens. Because the index of refraction of the lens is greater than that of air, the ray moves toward the perpendicular as it enters and away from the perpendicular as it leaves. (This is in accordance with the law of refraction.) As a result of the shape of the lens, light is thus bent toward the axis at both surfaces. Rays of light entering a convex, or converging, lens parallel to its axis converge at its focal point, F. Ray 2 lies on the axis of the lens. The distance from the center of the lens to the focal point is the focal length, ƒ, of the lens. An expanded view of the path taken by ray 1 shows the perpendiculars and the angles of incidence and refraction at both surfaces. Note that rays from a light source placed at the focal point of a converging lens emerge parallel from the other side of the lens. You may have heard of the trick of using a converging lens to focus rays of sunlight to a point. Such a concentration of light energy can produce enough heat to ignite paper. shows a concave lens and the effect it has on rays of light that enter it parallel to its axis (the path taken by ray 2 in the figure is the axis of the lens). The concave lens is a diverging lens because it causes the light rays to bend away (diverge) from its axis. In this case, the lens has been shaped so all light rays entering it parallel to its axis appear to originate from the same point, F, defined to be the focal point of a diverging lens. The distance from the center of the lens to the focal point is again called the focal length, or “ƒ,” of the lens. Note that the focal length of a diverging lens is defined to be negative. An expanded view of the path of one ray through the lens is shown in to illustrate how the shape of the lens, together with the law of refraction, causes the ray to follow its particular path and diverge. Rays of light enter a concave, or diverging, lens parallel to its axis diverge and thus appear to originate from its focal point, F. The dashed lines are not rays; they indicate the directions from which the rays appear to come. The focal length, ƒ, of a diverging lens is negative. An expanded view of the path taken by ray 1 shows the perpendiculars and the angles of incidence and refraction at both surfaces. The power, P, of a lens is very easy to calculate. It is simply the reciprocal of the focal length, expressed in meters P= 1 f . The units of power are diopters, D, which are expressed in reciprocal meters. If the focal length is negative, as it is for the diverging lens in , then the power is also negative. Teacher Support [BL][OL]Explain that for ray tracing, the focal point is needed. It is possible to calculate the location of the focal point using the law of refraction (Snell’s law) and the refractive index of the lens material, but this process is time-consuming and difficult to do accurately. Repeat the definitions of real, virtual, upright, and inverted, as they apply to images. It is an unfortunate fact that the word power is used for two completely different concepts. If you examine a prescription for eyeglasses, the lens powers are given in diopters. If you examine the label on a motor, the energy consumption rate is given as power in watts. In some circumstances, a lens forms an image at an obvious location, such as when a movie projector casts an image onto a screen. In other cases, the image location is less obvious. Where, for example, is the image formed by eyeglasses? We use ray tracing for thin lenses to illustrate how they form images, and we develop equations to describe the image-formation quantitatively. These are the rules for ray tracing: A ray entering a converging lens parallel to its axis passes through the focal point, F, of the lens on the other side A ray entering a diverging lens parallel to its axis seems to come from the focal point, F, on the side of the entering ray A ray passing through the center of either a converging or a diverging lens does not change direction A ray entering a converging lens through its focal point exits parallel to its axis A ray that enters a diverging lens by heading toward the focal point on the opposite side exits parallel to the axis Consider an object some distance away from a converging lens, as shown in . To find the location and size of the image formed, we trace the paths of select light rays originating from one point on the object. In this example, the originating point is the top of a woman’s head. shows three rays from the top of the object that can be traced using the ray-tracing rules just listed. Rays leave this point traveling in many directions, but we concentrate on only a few, which have paths that are easy to trace. The first ray is one that enters the lens parallel to its axis and passes through the focal point on the other side (rule 1). The second ray passes through the center of the lens without changing direction (rule 3). The third ray passes through the nearer focal point on its way into the lens and leaves the lens parallel to its axis (rule 4). All rays that come from the same point on the top of the person’s head are refracted in such a way as to cross at the same point on the other side of the lens. The image of the top of the person’s head is located at this point. Rays from another point on the object, such as the belt buckle, also cross at another common point, forming a complete image, as shown. Although three rays are traced in , only two are necessary to locate the image. It is best to trace rays for which there are simple ray-tracing rules. Before applying ray tracing to other situations, let us consider the example shown in in more detail. Ray tracing is used to locate the image formed by a lens. Rays originating from the same point on the object are traced. The three chosen rays each follow one of the rules for ray tracing, so their paths are easy to determine. The image is located at the point where the rays cross. In this case, a real image—one that can be projected on a screen—is formed. The image formed in is a real image—meaning, it can be projected. That is, light rays from one point on the object actually cross at the location of the image and can be projected onto a screen, a piece of film, or the retina of an eye. In , the object distance, do, is greater than f. Now we consider a ray diagram for a convex lens where do< f, and another diagram for a concave lens. Geometric Optics This animation shows you how the image formed by a convex lens changes as you change object distance, curvature radius, refractive index, and diameter of the lens. To begin, choose Principal Rays in the upper left menu and then try varying some of the parameters indicated at the upper center. Show Help supplies a few helpful labels. Teacher Support After students become familiar with the operation of the animation, have them select the 2nd Point option at the lower left of the menu. This option provides the rays from a second point on the object. This point can be adjusted so that rays from both the top and, for example, the center of the object may be studied. Three Types of Images Formed by Lenses Type Formed When Image Type di M Case 1 f positive, do > f Real Positive Negative m >, <, or = ‒1 Case 2 f positive, do < f Virtual Negative Positive m > 1 Case 3 f negative Virtual Negative Positive m < 1 The examples in and represent the three possible cases—case 1, case 2, and case 3—summarized in . In the table, m is magnification; the other symbols have the same meaning as they did for curved mirrors. (a) The image is virtual and larger than the object. (b) The image is virtual and smaller than the object. Focal Length Temperature extremes—Very hot or very cold temperatures are encountered in this lab that can cause burns. Use protective mitts, eyewear, and clothing when handling very hot or very cold objects. Notify your teacher immediately of any burns. EYE SAFETY—Looking at the Sun directly can cause permanent eye damage. Do not look at the Sun through any lens. Several lenses A sheet of white paper A ruler or tape measure Instructions Procedure Find several lenses and determine whether they are converging or diverging. In general, those that are thicker near the edges are diverging and those that are thicker near the center are converging. On a bright, sunny day take the converging lenses outside and try focusing the sunlight onto a sheet of white paper. Determine the focal lengths of the lenses. Have one partner slowly move the lens toward and away from the paper until you find the distance at which the light spot is at its brightest. Have the other partner measure the distance from the lens to the bright spot. Be careful, because the paper may start to burn, depending on the type of lens. Teacher Support Be sure there are no flammable materials near the place where you do the experiment. For example, bare concrete pavement is acceptable, but dry, brown grass or leaves is not. Do not look at the Sun through any lens! This could cause permanent eye damage! True or false—The bright spot that appears in focus on the paper is an image of the Sun. True False Teacher Support [BL]Ask students to name as many tools and instruments as they can that incorporate one or more lenses. Fill in the ones they miss with magnifying glass, camera, eye, telescope, microscope, and movie and slide projectors. [OL]Explain how the human eye is analogous to a camera. Discuss where the lens, aperture, and focal point is in each. Discuss how a camera focuses objects at different distances by moving the lens whereas the eye does this by changing the shape of the lens. [AL]Ask students to define index of refraction and explain how it affects the path of light rays passing through a lens. How would the path vary with changes in the index of refraction of the lens material? With changes in the wavelengths that make up the light ray? Image formation by lenses can also be calculated from simple equations. We learn how these calculations are carried out near the end of this section. Some common applications of lenses with which we are all familiar are magnifying glasses, eyeglasses, cameras, microscopes, and telescopes. We take a look at the latter two examples, which are the most complex. We have already seen the design of a telescope that uses only mirrors in . shows the design of a telescope that uses two lenses. Part (a) of the figure shows the design of the telescope used by Galileo. It produces an upright image, which is more convenient for many applications. Part (b) shows an arrangement of lenses used in many astronomical telescopes. This design produces an inverted image, which is less of a problem when viewing celestial objects. Teacher Support [OL][AL]Explain why it does not matter whether an image of a celestial object is inverted. Ask your students whether they agree with the statement: There is no up or down in space. We do not realize that light rays come from every part of an object and pass through every part of the lens; all are used to form the final image. In general, we feel the entire lens, or mirror, is needed to form an image. Actually, half a lens forms the same, although fainter, image. (a) Galileo made telescopes with a convex objective and a concave eyepiece. They produce an upright image and are used in spyglasses. (b) Most simple telescopes have two convex lenses. The objective forms a case 1 image, which is the object for the eyepiece. The eyepiece forms a case 2 final image that is magnified. shows the path of light through a typical microscope. Microscopes were first developed during the early 1600s by eyeglass makers in the Netherlands and Denmark. The simplest compound microscope is constructed from two convex lenses, as shown schematically in . The first lens is called the objective lens; it has typical magnification values from 5 × to 100 × . In standard microscopes, the objectives are mounted such that when you switch between them, the sample remains in focus. Objectives arranged in this way are described as parfocal. The second lens, the eyepiece, also referred to as the ocular, has several lenses that slide inside a cylindrical barrel. The focusing ability is provided by the movement of both the objective lens and the eyepiece. The purpose of a microscope is to magnify small objects, and both lenses contribute to the final magnification. In addition, the final enlarged image is produced in a location far enough from the observer to be viewed easily because the eye cannot focus on objects or images that are too close. A compound microscope composed of two lenses, an objective and an eyepiece. The objective forms a case 1 image that is larger than the object. This first image is the object for the eyepiece. The eyepiece forms a case 2 final image that is magnified even further. Real lenses behave somewhat differently from how they are modeled using rays diagrams or the thin-lens equations. Real lenses produce aberrations. An aberration is a distortion in an image. There are a variety of aberrations that result from lens size, material, thickness, and the position of the object. One common type of aberration is chromatic aberration, which is related to color. Because the index of refraction of lenses depends on color, or wavelength, images are produced at different places and with different magnifications for different colors. The law of reflection is independent of wavelength, so mirrors do not have this problem. This result is another advantage for the use of mirrors in optical systems such as telescopes. (a) shows chromatic aberration for a single convex lens, and its partial correction with a two-lens system. The index of refraction of the lens increases with decreasing wavelength, so violet rays are refracted more than red rays, and are thus focused closer to the lens. The diverging lens corrects this in part, although it is usually not possible to do so completely. Lenses made of different materials and with different dispersions may be used. For example, an achromatic doublet consisting of a converging lens made of crown glass in contact with a diverging lens made of flint glass can reduce chromatic aberration dramatically ((b)). (a) Chromatic aberration is caused by the dependence of a lens’s index of refraction on color (wavelength). The lens is more powerful for violet (V) than for red (R), producing images with different colors, locations, and magnifications. (b) Multiple-lens systems can correct chromatic aberrations in part, but they may require lenses of different materials and add to the expense of optical systems such as cameras. Physics of the Eye Teacher Support [BL]Review bending of light by refraction at a boundary between media of differing refracting indices. Note that the greater the difference in refraction indices, the more the light is bent. [OL]Show students a camera and point out the parts of the camera that have the same function as analogous parts of the eye: aperture (iris), lens (lens), film or light-sensitive screen (retina), and memory (brain). [AL]Have students with glasses compare them. Ask if they know whether their glasses correct for nearsightedness or farsightedness. Explain why glasses that correct nearsightedness are diverging (concave) and why glasses that correct farsightedness are converging (convex). The eye is perhaps the most interesting of all optical instruments. It is remarkable in how it forms images and in the richness of detail and color they eye can detect. However, our eyes commonly need some correction to reach what is called normal vision, but should be called ideal vision instead. Image formation by our eyes and common vision correction are easy to analyze using geometric optics. shows the basic anatomy of the eye. The cornea and lens form a system that, to a good approximation, acts as a single thin lens. For clear vision, a real image must be projected onto the light-sensitive retina, which lies at a fixed distance from the lens. The lens of the eye adjusts its power to produce an image on the retina for objects at different distances. The center of the image falls on the fovea, which has the greatest density of light receptors and the greatest acuity (sharpness) in the visual field. There are no receptors at the place where the optic nerve meets the eye, which is called the blind spot. An image falling on this spot cannot be seen. The variable opening (or pupil) of the eye along with chemical adaptation allows the eye to detect light intensities from the lowest observable to 1010 times greater (without damage). Ten orders of magnitude is an incredible range of detection. Our eyes perform a vast number of functions, such as sense direction, movement, sophisticated colors, and distance. Processing of visual nerve impulses begins with interconnections in the retina and continues in the brain. The optic nerve conveys signals received by the eye to the brain. The cornea and lens of an eye act together to form a real image on the light-sensing retina, which has its densest concentration of receptors in the fovea, and a blind spot over the optic nerve. The power of the lens of an eye is adjustable to provide an image on the retina for varying object distances. Refractive indices are crucial to image formation using lenses. shows refractive indices relevant to the eye. The biggest change in the refractive index—and the one that causes the greatest bending of rays—occurs at the cornea rather than the lens. The ray diagram in shows image formation by the cornea and lens of the eye. The rays bend according to the refractive indices provided in . The cornea provides about two-thirds of the magnification of the eye because the speed of light changes considerably while traveling from air into the cornea. The lens provides the remaining magnification needed to produce an image on the retina. The cornea and lens can be treated as a single thin lens, although the light rays pass through several layers of material (such as the cornea, aqueous humor, several layers in the lens, and vitreous humor), changing direction at each interface. The image formed is much like the one produced by a single convex lens. This result is a case 1 image. Images formed in the eye are inverted, but the brain inverts them once more to make them seem upright. Refractive Indices Relevant to the Eye Material Index of Refraction *The index of refraction varies throughout the lens and is greatest at its center. Water 1.33 Air 1.00 Cornea 1.38 Aqueous humor 1.34 Lens 1.41 average* Vitreous humor 1.34 An image is formed on the retina, with light rays converging most at the cornea and on entering and exiting the lens. Rays from the top and bottom of the object are traced and produce an inverted real image on the retina. The distance to the object is drawn smaller than scale. As noted, the image must fall precisely on the retina to produce clear vision—that is, the image distance, di, must equal the lens-to-retina distance. Because the lens-to-retina distance does not change, di must be the same for objects at all distances. The eye manages to vary the distance by varying the power (and focal length) of the lens to accommodate for objects at various distances. In , you can see the small ciliary muscles above and below the lens that change the shape of the lens and, thus, the focal length. The need for some type of vision correction is very common. Common vision defects are easy to understand, and some are simple to correct. illustrates two common vision defects. Nearsightedness, or myopia, is the inability to see distant objects clearly while close objects are in focus. The nearsighted eye overconverges the nearly parallel rays from a distant object, and the rays cross in front of the retina. More divergent rays from a close object are converged on the retina, producing a clear image. Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the inability to see close objects clearly whereas distant objects may be in focus. A farsighted eye does not converge rays from a close object sufficiently to make the rays meet on the retina. Less divergent rays from a distant object can be converged for a clear image. (a) The nearsighted (myopic) eye converges rays from a distant object in front of the retina; thus, they are diverging when they strike the retina, and produce a blurry image. This divergence can be caused by the lens of the eye being too powerful (in other words, too short a focal length) or the length of the eye being too great. (b) The farsighted (hyperopic) eye is unable to converge the rays from a close object by the time they strike the retina and produce ... blurry close vision. This poor convergence can be caused by insufficient power (in other words, too long a focal length) in the lens or by the eye being too short. Because the nearsighted eye overconverges light rays, the correction for nearsightedness involves placing a diverging spectacle lens in front of the eye. This lens reduces the power of an eye that has too short a focal length ((a)). Because the farsighted eye underconverges light rays, the correction for farsightedness is to place a converging spectacle lens in front of the eye. This lens increases the power of an eye that has too long a focal length ((b)). (a) Correction of nearsightedness requires a diverging lens that compensates for the overconvergence by the eye. The diverging lens produces an image closer to the eye than the object so that the nearsighted person can see it clearly. (b) Correction of farsightedness uses a converging lens that compensates for the underconvergence by the eye. The converging lens produces an image farther from the eye than the object so that the farsighted person can see it clearly. In both (a) and (b), the rays that meet at the retina represent corrected vision, and the other rays represent blurred vision without corrective lenses. Calculations Using Lens EquationsAs promised, there are no new equations to memorize. We can use equations already presented for solving problems involving curved mirrors. Careful analysis allows you to apply these equations to lenses. Here are the equations you need P= 1 f , where P is power, expressed in reciprocal meters (m–1) rather than diopters (D), and f is focal length, expressed in meters (m). You also need 1 f = 1 d i + 1 d o , where, as before, do and di are object distance and image distance, respectively. Remember, this equation is usually more useful if rearranged to solve for one of the variables. For example, d i = f d o d o −f . The equations for magnification, m, are also the same as for mirrors m= h i h o =− d i d o , where hi and ho are the image height and object height, respectively. Remember, also, that a negative di value indicates a virtual image and a negative hi value indicates an inverted image. These are the steps to follow when solving a lens problem: Step 1. Examine the situation to determine that image formation by a lens is involved. Step 2. Determine whether ray tracing, the thin-lens equations, or both should be used. A sketch is very helpful even if ray tracing is not specifically required by the problem. Write useful symbols and values on the sketch. Step 3. Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns). Step 4. Make a list of what is given or can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the knowns). It is helpful to determine whether the situation involves a case 1, 2, or 3 image. Although these are just names for types of images, they have certain characteristics (given in ) that can be of great use in solving problems. Step 5. If ray tracing is required, use the ray-tracing rules listed earlier in this section. Step 6. Most quantitative problems require the use of the thin-lens equations. These equations are solved in the usual manner by substituting knowns and solving for unknowns. Several worked examples were included earlier and can serve as guides. Step 7. Check whether the answer is reasonable. Does it make sense? If you identified the type of image (case 1, 2, or 3) correctly, you should assess whether your answer is consistent with the type of image, magnification, and so on. All problems will be solved by one or more of the equations just presented, with ray tracing used only for general analysis of the problem. The steps then simplify to the following: Identify the unknown. Identify the knowns. Choose an equation, plug in the knowns, and solve for the unknown. Here are some worked examples: The Power of a Magnifying Glass Strategy The Sun is so far away that its rays are nearly parallel when they reach Earth. The magnifying glass is a convex (or converging) lens, focusing the nearly parallel rays of sunlight. Thus, the focal length of the lens is the distance from the lens to the spot, and its power, in diopters (D), is the inverse of this distance (in reciprocal meters). Solution The focal length of the lens is the distance from the center of the lens to the spot, which we know to be 8.00 cm. Thus, f=8.00cm. To find the power of the lens, we must first convert the focal length to meters; then, we substitute this value into the equation for power. P= 1 f = 1 0.0800 m =12.5 D Discussion This result demonstrates a relatively powerful lens. Remember that the power of a lens in diopters should not be confused with the familiar concept of power in watts. Image Formation by a Convex Lens A clear glass light bulb is placed 0.75 m from a convex lens with a 0.50 m focal length, as shown in . Use ray tracing to get an approximate location for the image. Then, use the mirror/lens equations to calculate (a) the location of the image and (b) its magnification. Verify that ray tracing and the thin-lens and magnification equations produce consistent results. A light bulb placed 0.75 m from a lens with a 0.50 m focal length produces a real image on a poster board, as discussed in the previous example. Ray tracing predicts the image location and size. Strategy Because the object is placed farther away from a converging lens than the focal length of the lens, this situation is analogous to the one illustrated in the previous figure of a series of drawings showing a woman standing to the left of a lens. Ray tracing to scale should produce similar results for di. Numerical solutions for di and m can be obtained using the thin-lens and magnification equations, noting that do = 0.75 m and f = 0.50 m. Solution The ray tracing to scale in shows two rays from a point on the bulb’s filament crossing about 1.50 m on the far side of the lens. Thus, the image distance, di, is about 1.50 m. Similarly, the image height based on ray tracing is greater than the object height by about a factor of two, and the image is inverted. Thus, m is about –2. The minus sign indicates the image is inverted. The lens equation can be rearranged to solve for di from the given information. d i = f d o d o −f = (0.50)(0.75) 0.75–0.50 =1.5 m Now, we use dido to find m. m=− d i d o =− 1.5 0.75 =−2.0 Discussion Note that the minus sign causes the magnification to be negative when the image is inverted. Ray tracing and the use of the lens equation produce consistent results. The thin-lens equation gives the most precise results, and is limited only by the accuracy of the given information. Ray tracing is limited by the accuracy with which you draw, but it is highly useful both conceptually and visually. Image Formation by a Concave Lens Suppose an object, such as a book page, is held 6.50 cm from a concave lens with a focal length of –10.0 cm. Such a lens could be used in eyeglasses to correct pronounced nearsightedness. What magnification is produced? Strategy This example is identical to the preceding one, except that the focal length is negative for a concave or diverging lens. The method of solution is therefore the same, but the results are different in important ways. Solution d i = f d o d o −f = (−10.0)(6.50) 6.50−(−10.0) =−3.94 cm Now the magnification equation can be used to find the magnification, m, because both di and do are known. Entering their values gives m=− d i d o =− −3.94 6.50 =0.606. Discussion A number of results in this example are true of all case 3 images. Magnification is positive (as calculated), meaning the image is upright. The magnification is also less than one, meaning the image is smaller than the object—in this case, a little more than half its size. The image distance is negative, meaning the image is on the same side of the lens as the object. The image is virtual. The image is closer to the lens than the object, because the image distance is smaller in magnitude than the object distance. The location of the image is not obvious when you look through a concave lens. In fact, because the image is smaller than the object, you may think it is farther away; however, the image is closer than the object—a fact that is useful in correcting nearsightedness. The Lens Equation and Problem Solving The video shows calculations for both concave and convex lenses. It also explains real versus virtual images, erect versus inverted images, and the significance of negative and positive signs for the involved variables. Practice Problems If a lens produces a 5.00 -cm tall image of an 8.00 -cm -high object when placed 10.0 cm from the lens, what is the apparent image distance?

If students are struggling with a specific objective, these questions help identify which one, and then you can direct students to the relevant content. Which part of the eye controls the amount of light that enters? the pupil the iris the cornea the retina Section Summary The characteristics of images formed by concave and convex lenses can be predicted using ray tracing. Characteristics include real versus virtual, inverted versus upright, and size. The human eye and corrective lenses can be explained using geometric optics. Characteristics of images formed by lenses can be calculated using the mirror/lens equation.

A ray perpendicular to the axis and a ray through the center of the lens A ray parallel to the axis and a ray that does not pass through the center of the lens A ray parallel to the axis and a ray through the center of the lens A ray parallel to the axis and a ray that does not pass through the focal point For a concave lens, if the image distance, di, is negative, where does the image appear to be with respect to the object? The image always appears on the same side of the lens. The image appears on the opposite side of the lens. The image appears on the opposite side of the lens only if the object distance is greater than the focal length. The image appears on the same side of the lens only if the object distance is less than the focal length. Critical Thinking When you focus a camera, you adjust the distance of the lens from the film. If the camera lens acts like a thin lens, why can it not be kept at a fixed distance from the film for both near and distant objects? To focus on a distant object, you need to increase the image distance. To focus on a distant object, you need to increase the focal length of the lens. To focus on a distant object, you need to decrease the focal length of the lens. To focus on a distant object, you may need to increase or decrease the focal length of the lens.

Remind students that, in the previous chapter, they learned about the ray aspect of light and the phenomena that can be explained in terms of rays. Those included reflection and refraction and their related applications, such as curved mirrors and lenses. Explain that, in this chapter, they will be looking at light behavior that is explained by light as waves. That will include diffraction and interference, as demonstrated by light when it passes through narrow slits. Finally, they will look at applications related to waves, including lasers, spectroscopes, and the resolution of optical instruments. [BL]Recall that the speed of light is a fundamental constant. It is also the fastest possible speed. [OL]Review the similarities and differences of light waves, sound waves, and water waves.

[AL]Ask students to recall any wave behavior they have witnessed on the surfaces of bodies of water. Do they understand how those waves propagate? Have they seen two wavefronts interfering? Can they describe patterns of crests and troughs? Ask students to compare the speeds of light, sound, and water waves. Correct any large misconceptions about relative speeds. Light travels about one million times faster than sound, which travels about one hundred times faster than water waves. Examine a compact disc under white light, noting the colors observed and their locations on the disc. Using the CD, explore the spectra of a few light sources, such as a candle flame, an incandescent bulb, and fluorescent light. If you have ever looked at the reds, blues, and greens in a sunlit soap bubble and wondered how straw-colored soapy water could produce them, you have hit upon one of the many phenomena that can only be explained by the wave character of light. That and other interesting phenomena, such as the dispersion of white light into a rainbow of colors when passed through a narrow slit, cannot be explained fully by geometric optics. In such cases, light interacts with small objects and exhibits its wave characteristics. The topic of this chapter is the branch of optics that considers the behavior of light when it exhibits wave characteristics.

The student knows the characteristics and behavior of waves. The student is expected to: (D) investigate behaviors of waves, including reflection, refraction, diffraction, interference, resonance, and the Doppler effect Section Key Terms diffraction Huygens’s principle monochromatic wavefront Diffraction and Interference Teacher Support [BL]Explain constructive and destructive interference graphically on the board. [OL]Ask students to look closely at a shadow. Ask why the edges are not sharp lines. Explain that this is caused by diffraction, one of the wave properties of electromagnetic radiation. Define the nanometer in relation to other metric length measurements. [AL]Ask students which, among speed, frequency, and wavelength, stay the same, and which change, when a ray of light travels from one medium to another. Discuss those quantities in terms of colors (wavelengths) of visible light. We know that visible light is the type of electromagnetic wave to which our eyes responds. As we have seen previously, light obeys the equation c=fλ, where c=3.00× 10 8 m/s is the speed of light in vacuum, f is the frequency of the electromagnetic wave in Hz (or s–1), and λ is its wavelength in m. The range of visible wavelengths is approximately 380 to 750 nm. As is true for all waves, light travels in straight lines and acts like a ray when it interacts with objects several times as large as its wavelength. However, when it interacts with smaller objects, it displays its wave characteristics prominently. Interference is the identifying behavior of a wave. In , both the ray and wave characteristics of light can be seen. The laser beam emitted by the observatory represents ray behavior, as it travels in a straight line. Passing a pure, one-wavelength beam through vertical slits with a width close to the wavelength of the beam reveals the wave character of light. Here we see the beam spreading out horizontally into a pattern of bright and dark regions that are caused by systematic constructive and destructive interference. As it is characteristic of wave behavior, interference is observed for water waves, sound waves, and light waves. (a) The light beam emitted by a laser at the Paranal Observatory (part of the European Southern Observatory in Chile) acts like a ray, traveling in a straight line. (credit: Yuri Beletsky, European Southern Observatory) (b) A laser beam passing through a grid of vertical slits produces an interference pattern—characteristic of a wave. (credit: Shim’on and Slava Rybka, Wikimedia Commons) That interference is a characteristic of energy propagation by waves is demonstrated more convincingly by water waves. shows water waves passing through gaps between some rocks. You can easily see that the gaps are similar in width to the wavelength of the waves and that this causes an interference pattern as the waves pass beyond the gaps. A cross-section across the waves in the foreground would show the crests and troughs characteristic of an interference pattern. Incoming waves (at the top of the picture) pass through the gaps in the rocks and create an interference pattern (in the foreground). Light has wave characteristics in various media as well as in a vacuum. When light goes from a vacuum to some medium, such as water, its speed and wavelength change, but its frequency, f, remains the same. The speed of light in a medium is v=c/n , where n is its index of refraction. If you divide both sides of the equation c=fλ by n, you get c/n=v=fλ/n . Therefore, v=f λ n , where λ n is the wavelength in a medium, and λ n = λ n , where λ is the wavelength in vacuum and n is the medium’s index of refraction. It follows that the wavelength of light is smaller in any medium than it is in vacuum. In water, for example, which has n = 1.333, the range of visible wavelengths is (380 nm)/1.333 to (760 nm)/1.333, or λ n = 285–570 nm. Although wavelengths change while traveling from one medium to another, colors do not, since colors are associated with frequency. The Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens (1629–1695) developed a useful technique for determining in detail how and where waves propagate. He used wavefronts, which are the points on a wave’s surface that share the same, constant phase (such as all the points that make up the crest of a water wave). Huygens’s principle states, “Every point on a wavefront is a source of wavelets that spread out in the forward direction at the same speed as the wave itself. The new wavefront is a line tangent to all of the wavelets.” shows how Huygens’s principle is applied. A wavefront is the long edge that moves; for example, the crest or the trough. Each point on the wavefront emits a semicircular wave that moves at the propagation speed v. These are drawn later at a time, t, so that they have moved a distance s=vt . The new wavefront is a line tangent to the wavelets and is where the wave is located at time t. Huygens’s principle works for all types of waves, including water waves, sound waves, and light waves. It will be useful not only in describing how light waves propagate, but also in how they interfere. Huygens’s principle applied to a straight wavefront. Each point on the wavefront emits a semicircular wavelet that moves a distance s=vt . The new wavefront is a line tangent to the wavelets. What happens when a wave passes through an opening, such as light shining through an open door into a dark room? For light, you expect to see a sharp shadow of the doorway on the floor of the room, and you expect no light to bend around corners into other parts of the room. When sound passes through a door, you hear it everywhere in the room and, thus, you understand that sound spreads out when passing through such an opening. What is the difference between the behavior of sound waves and light waves in this case? The answer is that the wavelengths that make up the light are very short, so that the light acts like a ray. Sound has wavelengths on the order of the size of the door, and so it bends around corners. Teacher Support [OL]Discuss the fact that, for a diffraction pattern to be visible, the width of a slit must be roughly the wavelength of the light. Try to give students an idea of the size of visible light wavelengths by noting that a human hair is roughly 100 times wider. If light passes through smaller openings, often called slits, you can use Huygens’s principle to show that light bends as sound does (see ). The bending of a wave around the edges of an opening or an obstacle is called diffraction. Diffraction is a wave characteristic that occurs for all types of waves. If diffraction is observed for a phenomenon, it is evidence that the phenomenon is produced by waves. Thus, the horizontal diffraction of the laser beam after it passes through slits in is evidence that light has the properties of a wave. Huygens’s principle applied to a straight wavefront striking an opening. The edges of the wavefront bend after passing through the opening, a process called diffraction. The amount of bending is more extreme for a small opening, consistent with the fact that wave characteristics are most noticeable for interactions with objects about the same size as the wavelength. Once again, water waves present a familiar example of a wave phenomenon that is easy to observe and understand, as shown in . Ocean waves pass through an opening in a reef, resulting in a diffraction pattern. Diffraction occurs because the opening is similar in width to the wavelength of the waves. Single-Slit Interference This video works through the math needed to predict diffraction patterns that are caused by single-slit interference. Which values of m denote the location of destructive interference in a single-slit diffraction pattern? whole integers, excluding zero whole integers real numbers excluding zero real numbers The fact that Huygens’s principle worked was not considered enough evidence to prove that light is a wave. People were also reluctant to accept light’s wave nature because it contradicted the ideas of Isaac Newton, who was still held in high esteem. The acceptance of the wave character of light came after 1801, when the English physicist and physician Thomas Young (1773–1829) did his now-classic double-slit experiment (see ). Young’s double-slit experiment. Here, light of a single wavelength passes through a pair of vertical slits and produces a diffraction pattern on the screen—numerous vertical light and dark lines that are spread out horizontally. Without diffraction and interference, the light would simply make two lines on the screen. When light passes through narrow slits, it is diffracted into semicircular waves, as shown in (a). Pure constructive interference occurs where the waves line up crest to crest or trough to trough. Pure destructive interference occurs where they line up crest to trough. The light must fall on a screen and be scattered into our eyes for the pattern to be visible. An analogous pattern for water waves is shown in (b). Note that regions of constructive and destructive interference move out from the slits at well-defined angles to the original beam. Those angles depend on wavelength and the distance between the slits, as you will see below. Double slits produce two sources of waves that interfere. (a) Light spreads out (diffracts) from each slit, because the slits are narrow. The waves overlap and interfere constructively (bright lines) and destructively (dark regions). You can only see the effect if the light falls onto a screen and is scattered into your eyes. (b) The double-slit interference pattern for water waves is nearly identical to that for light. Wave action is greatest in regions of constructive interference and least in regions of destructive interference. (c) When light that has passed through double slits falls on a screen, we see a pattern such as this. Wave Interference This simulation demonstrates most of the wave phenomena discussed in this section. First, observe interference between two sources of electromagnetic radiation without adding slits. See how water waves, sound, and light all show interference patterns. Stay with light waves and use only one source. Create diffraction patterns with one slit and then with two. You may have to adjust slit width to see the pattern. Visually compare the slit width to the wavelength. When do you get the best-defined diffraction pattern? when the slit width is larger than the wavelength when the slit width is smaller than the wavelength when the slit width is comparable to the wavelength when the slit width is infinite Calculations Involving Diffraction and Interference Teacher Support [BL]The Greek letter θ is spelled theta. The Greek letter λ is spelled lamda. Both are pronounced the way you would expect from the spelling. The plurals of maximum and minimum are maxima and minima, respectively. [OL]Explain that monochromatic means one color. Monochromatic also means one frequency. The sine of an angle is the opposite side of a right triangle divided by the hypotenuse. Opposite means opposite the given acute angle. Note that the sign of an angle is always ≥ 1. The fact that the wavelength of light of one color, or monochromatic light, can be calculated from its two-slit diffraction pattern in Young’s experiments supports the conclusion that light has wave properties. To understand the basis of such calculations, consider how two waves travel from the slits to the screen. Each slit is a different distance from a given point on the screen. Thus different numbers of wavelengths fit into each path. Waves start out from the slits in phase (crest to crest), but they will end up out of phase (crest to trough) at the screen if the paths differ in length by half a wavelength, interfering destructively. If the paths differ by a whole wavelength, then the waves arrive in phase (crest to crest) at the screen, interfering constructively. More generally, if the paths taken by the two waves differ by any half-integral number of wavelengths ( 1 2 λ, 3 2 λ, 5 2 λ, etc.) , then destructive interference occurs. Similarly, if the paths taken by the two waves differ by any integral number of wavelengths (λ, 2λ, 3λ, etc.) , then constructive interference occurs. shows how to determine the path-length difference for waves traveling from two slits to a common point on a screen. If the screen is a large distance away compared with the distance between the slits, then the angle θ between the path and a line from the slits perpendicular to the screen (see the figure) is nearly the same for each path. That approximation and simple trigonometry show the length difference, ΔL , to be dsinθ , where d is the distance between the slits, ΔL=dsinθ. To obtain constructive interference for a double slit, the path-length difference must be an integral multiple of the wavelength, or dsinθ=mλ, for m=0,1,−1,2,−2,…(constructive). Similarly, to obtain destructive interference for a double slit, the path-length difference must be a half-integral multiple of the wavelength, or dsinθ=(m+½)λ, for m=0,1,−1,2,−2,…(destructive). The number m is the order of the interference. For example, m = 4 is fourth-order interference. The paths from each slit to a common point on the screen differ by an amount d sin θ , assuming the distance to the screen is much greater than the distance between the slits (not to scale here). shows how the intensity of the bands of constructive interference decreases with increasing angle. The interference pattern for a double slit has an intensity that falls off with angle. The photograph shows multiple bright and dark lines, or fringes, formed by light passing through a double slit. Light passing through a single slit forms a diffraction pattern somewhat different from that formed by double slits. shows a single-slit diffraction pattern. Note that the central maximum is larger than those on either side, and that the intensity decreases rapidly on either side. (a) Single-slit diffraction pattern. Monochromatic light passing through a single slit produces a central maximum and many smaller and dimmer maxima on either side. The central maximum is six times higher than shown. (b) The drawing shows the bright central maximum and dimmer and thinner maxima on either side. (c) The location of the minima are shown in terms of λ and D. The analysis of single-slit diffraction is illustrated in . Assuming the screen is very far away compared with the size of the slit, rays heading toward a common destination are nearly parallel. That approximation allows a series of trigonometric operations that result in the equations for the minima produced by destructive interference. Dsinθ=mλ or Dy L =mλ When rays travel straight ahead, they remain in phase and a central maximum is obtained. However, when rays travel at an angle θ relative to the original direction of the beam, each ray travels a different distance to the screen, and they can arrive in or out of phase. Thus, a ray from the center travels a distance λ/2 farther than the ray from the top edge of the slit, they arrive out of phase, and they interfere destructively. Similarly, for every ray between the top and the center of the slit, there is a ray between the center and the bottom of the slit that travels a distance λ/2 farther to the common point on the screen, and so interferes destructively. Symmetrically, there will be another minimum at the same angle below the direct ray. Equations for a single-slit diffraction pattern, where λ is the wavelength of light, D is the slit width, θ is the angle between a line from the slit to a minimum and a line perpendicular to the screen, L is the distance from the slit to the screen, y is the distance from the center of the pattern to the minimum, and m is a nonzero integer indicating the order of the minimum. Below we summarize the equations needed for the calculations to follow. The speed of light in a vacuum, c, the wavelength of the light, λ , and its frequency, f, are related as follows. c=fλ The wavelength of light in a medium, λ n , compared to its wavelength in a vacuum, λ , is given by λ n = λ n . To calculate the positions of constructive interference for a double slit, the path-length difference must be an integral multiple, m, of the wavelength. λ dsinθ=mλ, for m=0,1,−1,2,−2,…(constructive), where d is the distance between the slits and θ is the angle between a line from the slits to the maximum and a line perpendicular to the barrier in which the slits are located. To calculate the positions of destructive interference for a double slit, the path-length difference must be a half-integral multiple of the wavelength: dsinθ=(m+½)λ, for m=0,1,−1,2,−2,…(destructive). For a single-slit diffraction pattern, the width of the slit, D, the distance of the first (m = 1) destructive interference minimum, y, the distance from the slit to the screen, L, and the wavelength, λ , are given by Dy L =λ. Also, for single-slit diffraction, Dsinθ=mλ, where θ is the angle between a line from the slit to the minimum and a line perpendicular to the screen, and m is the order of the minimum. Two-Slit Interference Suppose you pass light from a He-Ne laser through two slits separated by 0.0100 mm, and you find that the third bright line on a screen is formed at an angle of 10.95º relative to the incident beam. What is the wavelength of the light? Strategy The third bright line is due to third-order constructive interference, which means that m = 3. You are given d = 0.0100 mm and θ = 10.95º. The wavelength can thus be found using the equation dsinθ=mλ for constructive interference. Solution The equation is dsinθ=mλ . Solving for the wavelength, λ , gives λ= dsinθ m . Substituting known values yields λ= ( 0.0100 mm )( sin 10.95° ) 3 =6.33× 10 −4 mm=633 nm. Discussion To three digits, 633 nm is the wavelength of light emitted by the common He-Ne laser. Not by coincidence, this red color is similar to that emitted by neon lights. More important, however, is the fact that interference patterns can be used to measure wavelength. Young did that for visible wavelengths. His analytical technique is still widely used to measure electromagnetic spectra. For a given order, the angle for constructive interference increases with λ , so spectra (measurements of intensity versus wavelength) can be obtained. Single-Slit Diffraction Visible light of wavelength 550 nm falls on a single slit and produces its second diffraction minimum at an angle of 45.0° relative to the incident direction of the light. What is the width of the slit?Strategy From the given information, and assuming the screen is far away from the slit, you can use the equation Dsinθ=mλ to find D. Solution Quantities given are λ = 550 nm, m = 2, and θ 2 = 45.0°. Solving the equation Dsinθ=mλ for D and substituting known values gives D= mλ sinθ = 2(550 nm) sin45.0° =1.56× 10 −6 m. Discussion You see that the slit is narrow (it is only a few times greater than the wavelength of light). That is consistent with the fact that light must interact with an object comparable in size to its wavelength in order to exhibit significant wave effects, such as this single-slit diffraction pattern.

The student knows the characteristics and behavior of waves. The student is expected to: (D) investigate behaviors of waves, including reflection, refraction, diffraction, interference, resonance, and the Doppler effect and (F) describe the role of wave characteristics and behaviors in medical and industrial applications. Section Key Terms differential interference contrast (DIC) diffraction grating iridescence laser monochromator Rayleigh criterion resolution Wave-Based Applications of Light Teacher Support [BL]Define the terms laser, diffraction grating, and resolution. [OL]Remind students of the meaning of coherent light in terms of wave properties. Ask students to name examples of lasers and diffraction gratings. Suggest common ones they miss, such as lasers used in surgery, as pointers, for reading CDs, and diffraction gratings on the surface of CDs, iridescent minerals, backs of beetles, and in spectroscopes. [AL]Explain how, for very short wavelengths ( λ< 10 −12 m ), the limit of resolution is related to Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. Perfect resolution is impossible. There will always be some blurring of images, no matter what the size of the aperture or the wavelength of light used to make an image. In 1917, Albert Einstein was thinking about photons and excited atoms. He considered an atom excited by a certain amount of energy and what would happen if that atom were hit by a photon with the same amount of energy. He suggested that the atom would emit a photon with that amount of energy, and it would be accompanied by the original photon. The exciting part is that you would have two photons with the same energy and they would be in phase. Those photons could go on to hit other excited atoms, and soon you would have a stream of in-phase photons. Such a light stream is said to be coherent. Some four decades later, Einstein’s idea found application in a process called, light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. Take the first letters of all the words (except by and “of”) and write them in order. You get the word laser (see (a)), which is the name of the device that produces such a beam of light.Laser beams are directional, very intense, and narrow (only about 0.5 mm in diameter). These properties lead to a number of applications in industry and medicine. The following are just a few examples: This chapter began with a picture of a compact disc (see ). Those audio and data-storage devices began replacing cassette tapes during the 1990s. CDs are read by interpreting variations in reflections of a laser beam from the surface. Some barcode scanners use a laser beam. Lasers are used in industry to cut steel and other metals. Lasers are bounced off reflectors that astronauts left on the Moon. The time it takes for the light to make the round trip can be used to make precise calculations of the Earth-Moon distance. Laser beams are used to produce holograms. The name hologram means entire picture (from the Greek holo-, as in holistic), because the image is three-dimensional. A viewer can move around the image and see it from different perspectives. Holograms take advantage of the wave properties of light, as opposed to traditional photography which is based on geometric optics. A holographic image is produced by constructive and destructive interference of a split laser beam. One of the advantages of using a laser as a surgical tool is that it is accompanied by very little bleeding. Laser eye surgery has improved the vision of many people, without the need for corrective lenses. A laser beam is used to change the shape of the lens of the eye, thus changing its focal length. Lasers This animation allows you to examine the workings of a laser. First view the picture of a real laser. Change the energy of the incoming photons, and see if you can match it to an excitation level that will produce pairs of coherent photons. Change the excitation level and try to match it to the incoming photon energy. In the animation there is only one excited atom. Is that the case for a real laser? Explain. No, a laser would have two excited atoms. No, a laser would have several million excited atoms. Yes, a laser would have only one excited atom. No, a laser would have on the order of 1023 excited atoms. An interesting thing happens if you pass light through a large number of evenly-spaced parallel slits. Such an arrangement of slits is called a diffraction grating. An interference pattern is created that is very similar to the one formed by double-slit diffraction (see and ). A diffraction grating can be manufactured by scratching glass with a sharp tool to form a number of precisely positioned parallel lines, which act like slits. Diffraction gratings work both for transmission of light, as in , and for reflection of light, as on the butterfly wings or the Australian opal shown in , or the CD pictured in the opening illustration of this chapter. In addition to their use as novelty items, diffraction gratings are commonly used for spectroscopic dispersion and analysis of light. What makes them particularly useful is the fact that they form a sharper pattern than do double slits. That is, their bright regions are narrower and brighter, while their dark regions are darker. shows idealized graphs demonstrating the sharper pattern. Natural diffraction gratings occur in the feathers of certain birds. Tiny, fingerlike structures in regular patterns act as reflection gratings, producing constructive interference that gives the feathers colors not solely due to their pigmentation. The effect is called iridescence. A diffraction grating consists of a large number of evenly-spaced parallel slits. (a) Light passing through the grating is diffracted in a pattern similar to a double slit, with bright regions at various angles. (b) The pattern obtained for white light incident on a grating. The central maximum is white, and the higher-order maxima disperse white light into a rainbow of colors. (a) This Australian opal and (b) the butterfly wings have rows of reflectors that act like reflection gratings, reflecting different colors at different angles. (credit: (a) Opals-On-Black.com, via Flickr (b) whologwhy, Flickr) Idealized graphs of the intensity of light passing through a double slit (a) and a diffraction grating (b) for monochromatic light. Maxima can be produced at the same angles, but those for the diffraction grating are narrower, and hence sharper. The maxima become narrower and the regions between become darker as the number of slits is increased. Diffraction Grating A CD (compact disc) or DVD A measuring tape Sunlight near a white wall Instructions Procedure Hold the CD in direct sunlight near the wall, and move it around until a circular rainbow pattern appears on the wall. Measure the distance from the CD to the wall and the distance from the center of the circular pattern to a color in the rainbow. Use those two distances to calculate tanθ . Find sinθ . Look up the wavelength of the color you chose. That is λ . Solve dsinθ=mλ for d. Compare your answer to the usual spacing between CD tracks, which is 1,600 nm (1.6 μm). How do you know what number to use for m? Count the rainbow rings preceding the chosen color. Calculate mfrom the frequency of the light of the chosen color. Calculate m from the wavelength of the light of the chosen color. The value of m is fixed for every color. CD Players Can you see the grooves on a CD or DVD (see )? You may think you can because you know they are there, but they are extremely narrow—1,600 in a millimeter. Because the width of the grooves is similar to wavelengths of visible light, they form a diffraction grating. That is why you see rainbows on a CD. The colors are attractive, but they are incidental to the functions of storing and retrieving audio and other data. For its size, this CD holds a surprising amount of information. Likewise, the CD player it is in houses a surprising number of electronic devices. The grooves are actually one continuous groove that spirals outward from the center. Data are recorded in the grooves as binary code (zeroes and ones) in small pits. Information in the pits is detected by a laser that tracks along the groove. It gets even more complicated: The speed of rotation must be varied as the laser tracks toward the circumference so that the linear speed along the groove remains constant. There is also an error correction mechanism to prevent the laser beam from getting off track. A diffraction grating is used to create the first two maxima on either side of the track. If those maxima are not the same distance from the track, an error is indicated and then corrected. The pits are reflective because they have been coated with a thin layer of aluminum. That allows the laser beam to be reflected back and directed toward a photodiode detector. The signal can then be processed and converted to the audio we hear. The longest wavelength of visible light is about 780 nm . How does that compare to the distance between CD grooves? The grooves are about 3 times the longest wavelength of visible light. The grooves are about 2 times the longest wavelength of visible light. The grooves are about 2 times the shortest wavelength of visible light. The grooves are about 3 times the shortest wavelength of visible light. Biology: DIC Microscopy If you were completely transparent, it would be hard to recognize you from your photograph. The same problem arises when using a traditional microscope to view or photograph small transparent objects such as cells and microbes. Microscopes using differential interference contrast (DIC) solve the problem by making it possible to view microscopic objects with enhanced contrast, as shown in . This aquatic organism was photographed with a DIC microscope. (credit: Public Library of Science) A DIC microscope separates a polarized light source into two beams polarized at right angles to each other and coherent with each other, that is, in phase. After passing through the sample, the beams are recombined and realigned so they have the same plane of polarization. They then create an interference pattern caused by the differences in their optical path and the refractive indices of the parts of the sample they passed through. The result is an image with contrast and shadowing that could not be observed with traditional optics. Where are diffraction gratings used? Diffraction gratings are key components of monochromators—devices that separate the various wavelengths of incoming light and allow a beam with only a specific wavelength to pass through. Monochromators are used, for example, in optical imaging of particular wavelengths from biological or medical samples. A diffraction grating can be chosen to specifically analyze a wavelength of light emitted by molecules in diseased cells in a biopsy sample, or to help excite strategic molecules in the sample with a selected frequency of light. Another important use is in optical fiber technologies where fibers are designed to provide optimum performance at specific wavelengths. A range of diffraction gratings is available for selecting specific wavelengths for such use. Diffraction gratings are used in spectroscopes to separate a light source into its component wavelengths. When a material is heated to incandescence, it gives off wavelengths of light characteristic of the chemical makeup of the material. A pure substance will produce a spectrum that is unique, thus allowing identification of the substance. Spectroscopes are also used to measure wavelengths both shorter and longer than visible light. Such instruments have become especially useful to astronomers and chemists. shows a diagram of a spectroscope. The diagram shows the function of a diffraction grating in a spectroscope. Light diffracts as it moves through space, bending around obstacles and interfering constructively and destructively. While diffraction allows light to be used as a spectroscopic tool, it also limits the detail we can obtain in images. (a) shows the effect of passing light through a small circular aperture. Instead of a bright spot with sharp edges, a spot with a fuzzy edge surrounded by circles of light is obtained. This pattern is caused by diffraction similar to that produced by a single slit. Light from different parts of the circular aperture interferes constructively and destructively. The effect is most noticeable when the aperture is small, but the effect is there for large apertures, too. (a) Monochromatic light passed through a small circular aperture produces this diffraction pattern. (b) Two point light sources that are close to one another produce overlapping images because of diffraction. (c) If they are closer together, they cannot be resolved, that is, distinguished. How does diffraction affect the detail that can be observed when light passes through an aperture? (b) shows the diffraction pattern produced by two point light sources that are close to one another. The pattern is similar to that for a single point source, and it is just barely possible to tell that there are two light sources rather than one. If they are closer together, as in (c), you cannot distinguish them, thus limiting the detail, or resolution, you can obtain. That limit is an inescapable consequence of the wave nature of light. There are many situations in which diffraction limits the resolution. The acuity of vision is limited because light passes through the pupil, the circular aperture of the eye. Be aware that the diffraction-like spreading of light is due to the limited diameter of a light beam, not the interaction with an aperture. Thus light passing through a lens with a diameter of D shows the diffraction effect and spreads, blurring the image, just as light passing through an aperture of diameter D does. Diffraction limits the resolution of any system having a lens or mirror. Telescopes are also limited by diffraction, because of the finite diameter, D, of their primary mirror. Calculations Involving Diffraction Gratings and Resolution Teacher Support [BL]Review problem-solving techniques: Identify the knowns and unknowns. Convert measurements of the same property to the same units of measurements. Choose the equation and rearrange it, if necessary, to solve for the unknown. [OL]Review the meaning of arcsine in particular and of inverse trigonometric functions in general. Explain the radian as a unit of measure for angles, and relate it to degrees. Early in the chapter, it was mentioned that when light passes from one medium to another, its speed and wavelength change, but its frequency remains constant. The equation λ n = λ n shows how to the wavelength in a given medium, λ n , is related to the wavelength in a vacuum, λ , and the refractive index, n, of the medium. The equation is useful for calculating the change in wavelength of a monochromatic laser beam in various media. The analysis of a diffraction grating is very similar to that for a double slit. As you know from the discussion of double slits in Young’s double-slit experiment, light is diffracted by, and spreads out after passing through, each slit. Rays travel at an angle θ relative to the incident direction. Each ray travels a different distance to a common point on a screen far away. The rays start in phase, and they can be in or out of phase when they reach a screen, depending on the difference in the path lengths traveled. Each ray travels a distance that differs by dsinθ from that of its neighbor, where d is the distance between slits. If dsinθ equals an integral number of wavelengths, the rays all arrive in phase, and constructive interference (a maximum) is obtained. Thus, the condition necessary to obtain constructive interference for a diffraction grating is dsinθ=mλ,for m=0,1,−1,2,−2,…, where d is the distance between slits in the grating, λ is the wavelength of the light, and m is the order of the maximum. Note that this is exactly the same equation as for two slits separated by d. However, the slits are usually closer in diffraction gratings than in double slits, producing fewer maxima at larger angles. Diffraction Grating This video explains the geometry behind the diffraction pattern produced by a diffraction grating. Just what is the resolution limit of an aperture or lens? To answer that question, consider the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture, which, similar to the diffraction pattern of light passing through a slit, has a central maximum that is wider and brighter than the maxima surrounding it (see (a)). It can be shown that, for a circular aperture of diameter D, the first minimum in the diffraction pattern occurs at θ=1.22λ/D , provided that the aperture is large compared with the wavelength of light, which is the case for most optical instruments. The accepted criterion for determining the diffraction limit to resolution based on diffraction was developed by Lord Rayleigh in the 19th century. The Rayleigh criterion for the diffraction limit to resolution states that two images are just resolvable when the center of the diffraction pattern of one is directly over the first minimum of the diffraction pattern of the other. See (b). The first minimum is at an angle of θ=1.22λ/D , so that two point objects are just resolvable if they are separated by the angle θ=1.22 λ D , where λ is the wavelength of the light (or other electromagnetic radiation) and D is the diameter of the aperture, lens, mirror, etc., with which the two objects are observed. In the expression above, θ has units of radians. (a) Graph of intensity of the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture. Note that, similar to a single slit, the central maximum is wider and brighter than those to the sides. (b) Two point objects produce overlapping diffraction patterns. Shown here is the Rayleigh criterion for their being just resolvable. The central maximum of one pattern lies on the first minimum of the other. Resolution A sheet of white paper A black pen or pencil A measuring tape Instructions Procedure Draw two lines several mm apart on a white sheet of paper. Move away from the sheet as it is held upright, and measure the distance at which you can just distinguish (resolve) the lines as separate. Use θ=1.22 λ D to calculate D the diameter of your pupil. Use the distance between the lines and the maximum distance at which they were resolved to calculate θ . Use the average wavelength for visible light as the value for λ . Compare your answer to the average pupil diameter of 3 mm. Change of Wavelength A monochromatic laser beam of green light with a wavelength of 550 nm passes from air to water. The refractive index of water is 1.33. What will be the wavelength of the light after it enters the water? Strategy You can assume that the refractive index of air is the same as that of light in a vacuum because they are so close. You then have all the information you need to solve for λ n . Solution λ n = λ n = 550 nm 1.33 =414 nm Discussion The refractive index of air is 1.0003, so the approximation holds for three significant figures. You would not see the light change color, however. Color is determined by frequency, not wavelength. Diffraction Grating A diffraction grating has 2000 lines per centimeter. At what angle will the first-order maximum form for green light with a wavelength of 520 nm? Strategy You are given enough information to calculate d, and you are given the values of λ and m. You will have to find the arcsin of a number to find θ . Solution First find d. d= 1 cm 2,000 =5.00× 10 −4 cm = 5,000 nm Rearrange the equation for constructive interference conditions for a diffraction grating, and substitute the known values. dsinθ = mλ θ = sin −1 mλ d = sin −1 ( (1)(520) 5,000 ) = 5.97 Discussion This angle seems reasonable for the first maximum. Recall that the meaning of sin‒1 (or arcsin) is the angle with a sine that is (the unknown). Remember that the value of sinθ will not be greater than 1 for any value of θ . Resolution What is the minimum angular spread of a 633-nm-wavelength He-Ne laser beam that is originally 1.00 mm in diameter? Strategy The diameter of the beam is the same as if it were coming through an aperture of that size, so D = 1.00 mm. You are given λ , and you must solve for θ . Solution θ= (1.22)λ D = (1.22)(633 nm) 1.00× 10 6 nm =7.72× 10 −4 rad=0.0442° Discussion The conversion factor for radians to degrees is 1.000 radian = 57.3°. The spread is very small and would not be noticeable over short distances. The angle represents the angular separation of the central maximum and the first minimum.

It can be used to analyze spectra only in the infrared portion of the spectrum. It can be used to analyze spectra in the entire visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. It can only be used to analyze spectra in the short‐wavelength visible. It can only be used to analyze spectra in the short‐wavelength visible and ultraviolet.

Explain.? Yes, the beam passing through the hole will spread out as it travels, because it is diffracted by the edges of the hole, whereas the 1 -mm beam, which encounters no diffracting obstacle, will not spread out. Yes, the beam passing through the hole will be made more parallel by passing through the hole, and so will not spread out as it travels, whereas the unaltered wavefronts of the 1-mm beam will cause the beam to spread out as it travels. No, both beams will remain the same width as they travel, and they will not spread out. No, both beams will spread out as they travel.

A utility knife (a knife with a razor blade-like cutting edge) Aluminum foil A straight edge A strong, small light source or a laser pointer A tape measure A white wall Procedure Cut a piece of aluminum foil about 15 cm × 15 cm. Use the utility knife and the straight edge to cut a straight slit several cm long in the center of the foil square. With the room darkened, one partner shines the light through the slit and toward the wall. The other partner observes the pattern on the wall. The partner with the light changes the distance from the foil to the wall and the distance from the light to the foil. When the sharpest, brightest pattern possible is obtained, the partner who is not holding the foil and light makes measurements. Measure the perpendicular (shortest) distance from the slit to the wall, the distance from the center of the pattern to several of the dark bands, and the distance from the slit to the same dark bands. Carefully make a second slit parallel to the first slit and 1 mm or less away. Repeat steps 2 through 5, only this time measure the distances to bright bands. NOTE—In your calculations, use 580 nm for λ if you used white light. If you used a colored laser pointer, look up the wavelength of the color. You may find it easier to calculate θ from its tangent rather than from its sine. Which experiment gave the most distinct pattern—one or two slits? What was the width of the single slit? Compare the calculated distance with the measured distance. What was the distance between the two slits? Compare the calculated distance with the measured distance.

(credit: Ken Bosma, Wikimedia Commons) Teacher Support Ask students what they know about static electricity and about electric charge. Explain that static electricity is a field of study that focuses on the forces and electrical pressure between objects that have an imbalance of electric charge. Although the word static implies that nothing is moving, this is often not the case. For example, separating positive from negative charges involves charges in motion but creates static electricity. Likewise, a lightning strike is a huge electric current but is created by static electricity. Normally, static electricity phenomena involve high electric pressure and low, noncontinuous electric currents. Review Newton’s law of universal gravitation. Discuss how the force of gravity varies inversely with the distance squared between masses and how it is always an attractive force. Point out how the quantity that determines how strongly gravity acts on an object is its mass. Explain that electric charge is the analogous quantity that determines how strong electric forces are between objects that have nonzero electric charge. Teacher Support [BL][OL]Review the notion of repulsive and attractive forces. Discuss how forces can have the same magnitude but act in opposite directions. [AL]Explain that all the macroscopic forces that we experience directly, such as the sensations of touch and the tension in a rope, are due to the electromagnetic force, one of the four fundamental forces in nature. Electrostatic forces are a subset of electromagnetic forces, which are covered further in later chapters. The gravitational force, another fundamental force, is actually sensed through the electromagnetic interaction of molecules, such as between those in our feet and those on the top of a bathroom scale. The other two fundamental forces, the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force, cannot be sensed on the human scale. You may have been introduced to static electricity like the child sliding down the slide in the opening photograph (). The zap that he is likely to receive if he touches a playmate or parent tends to bring home the lesson. But static electricity is more than just fun and games—it is put to use in many industries. The forces between electrically charged particles are used in technologies such as printers, pollution filters, and spray guns used for painting cars and trucks. Static electricity is the study of phenomena that involve an imbalance of electrical charge. Although creating this imbalance typically requires moving charge around, once the imbalance is created, it often remains static for a long time. The study of charge in motion is called electromagnetism and will be covered in a later chapter. What is electrical charge, how is it associated with objects, and what forces does it create? These are just some of the questions that this chapter addresses. Teacher Support Before students begin this chapter, it would be useful to review the following concepts: Newton’s universal law of gravitation—Review its mathematical form and how it depends on the masses of the two objects involved and on the inverse square of the distance between the objects. Tell students that this chapter presents a similar inverse-square law that describes the force created by electric effects. Review vectors and vector addition—Remind students that vectors are defined by a magnitude and a direction and that adding vectors of the same magnitude but opposite direction results in zero (i.e., they cancel each other).", "formulas": [], "subsections": [{"id": "m54417", "content": "Introduction m54417 Introduction 733779ab-85cb-4bdc-b87d-8f217765027c This child’s hair contains an imbalance of electrical charge (commonly called static electricity), which causes it to stand on end.

Section Key Terms conduction conductor electron induction insulator law of conservation of charge polarization proton Electric Charge You may know someone who has an electric personality, which usually means that other people are attracted to this person. This saying is based on electric charge, which is a property of matter that causes objects to attract or repel each other. Electric charge comes in two varieties, which we call positive and negative. Like charges repel each other, and unlike charges attract each other. Thus, two positive charges repel each other, as do two negative charges. A positive charge and a negative charge attract each other.How do we know there are two types of electric charge? When various materials are rubbed together in controlled ways, certain combinations of materials always result in a net charge of one type on one material and a net charge of the opposite type on the other material. By convention, we call one type of charge positive and the other type negative. For example, when glass is rubbed with silk, the glass becomes positively charged and the silk negatively charged. Because the glass and silk have opposite charges, they attract one another like clothes that have rubbed together in a dryer. Two glass rods rubbed with silk in this manner will repel one another, because each rod has positive charge on it. Similarly, two silk cloths rubbed in this manner will repel each other, because both cloths have negative charge. shows how these simple materials can be used to explore the nature of the force between charges. A glass rod becomes positively charged when rubbed with silk, whereas the silk becomes negatively charged. (a) The glass rod is attracted to the silk, because their charges are opposite. (b) Two similarly charged glass rods repel. (c) Two similarly charged silk cloths repel. Teacher Support Prepare a demonstration of static electricity. A simple demonstration may be to charge a glass rod or comb by rubbing it with wool, silk, or other cloth and then charge an inflated balloon by rubbing it on your shirt or hair. Place the balloon on a nonconducting tabletop, and use the glass rod or comb to repel the balloon and make it roll across the tabletop. Amuse the students by pushing the balloon first in one direction and then quickly moving the glass rod or comb to the opposite side of the balloon to make it decelerate and then move in the opposite direction. Ask which type of force is at work between the balloon and the glass rod or comb (a repulsive force). It took scientists a long time to discover what lay behind these two types of charges. The word electric itself comes from the Greek word elektron for amber, because the ancient Greeks noticed that amber, when rubbed by fur, attracts dry straw. Almost 2,000 years later, the English physicist William Gilbert proposed a model that explained the effect of electric charge as being due to a mysterious electrical fluid that would pass from one object to another. This model was debated for several hundred years, but it was finally put to rest in 1897 by the work of the English physicist J. J. Thomson and French physicist Jean Perrin. Along with many others, Thomson and Perrin were studying the mysterious cathode rays that were known at the time to consist of particles smaller than the smallest atom. Perrin showed that cathode rays actually carried negative electrical charge. Later, Thomson’s work led him to declare, “I can see no escape from the conclusion that [cathode rays] are charges of negative electricity carried by particles of matter.” It took several years of further experiments to confirm Thomson’s interpretation of the experiments, but science had in fact discovered the particle that carries the fundamental unit of negative electrical charge. We now know this particle as the electron. Atoms, however, were known to be electrically neutral, which means that they carry the same amount of positive and negative charge, so their net charge is zero. Because electrons are negative, some other part of the atom must contain positive charge. Thomson put forth what is called the plum pudding model, in which he described atoms as being made of thousands of electrons swimming around in a nebulous mass of positive charge, as shown by the left-side image of . His student, Ernest Rutherford, originally believed that this model was correct and used it (along with other models) to try to understand the results of his experiments bombarding gold foils with alpha particles (i.e., helium atoms stripped of their electrons). The results, however, did not confirm Thomson’s model but rather destroyed it! Rutherford found that most of the space occupied by the gold atoms was actually empty and that almost all of the matter of each atom was concentrated into a tiny, extremely dense nucleus, as shown by the right-side image of . The atomic nucleus was later found to contain particles called protons, each of which carries a unit of positive electric charge.Protons were later found to contain sub particles called quarks, which have fractional electric charge. But that is another story that we leave for subsequent physics courses. The left drawing shows Thompson’s plum-pudding model, in which the electrons swim around in a nebulous mass of positive charge. The right drawing shows Rutherford’s model, in which the electrons orbit around a tiny, massive nucleus. Note that the size of the nucleus is vastly exaggerated in this drawing. Were it drawn to scale with respect to the size of the electron orbits, the nucleus would not be visible to the naked eye in this drawing. Also, as far as science can currently detect, electrons are point particles, which means that they have no size at all! Protons and electrons are thus the fundamental particles that carry electric charge. Each proton carries one unit of positive charge, and each electron carries one unit of negative charge. To the best precision that modern technology can provide, the charge carried by a proton is exactly the opposite of that carried by an electron. The SI unit for electric charge is the coulomb (abbreviated as “C”), which is named after the French physicist Charles Augustin de Coulomb, who studied the force between charged objects. The proton carries +1.602× 10 −19 C. and the electron carries −1.602× 10 −19 C, . The number n of protons required to make +1.00 C is n=1.00C× 1proton 1.602× 10 −19 C =6.25× 10 18 protons. The same number of electrons is required to make −1.00 C of electric charge. The fundamental unit of charge is often represented as e. Thus, the charge on a proton is e, and the charge on an electron is −e. Mathematically, e=+1.602× 10 −19 C. Measuring the Fundamental Electric Charge The American physicist Robert Millikan (1868–1953) and his student Harvey Fletcher (1884–1981) were the first to make a relatively accurate measurement of the fundamental unit of charge on the electron. They designed what is now a classic experiment performed by students. The Millikan oil-drop experiment is shown in . The experiment involves some concepts that will be introduced later, but the basic idea is that a fine oil mist is sprayed between two plates that can be charged with a known amount of opposite charge. Some oil drops accumulate some excess negative charge when being sprayed and are attracted to the positive charge of the upper plate and repelled by the negative charge on the lower plate. By tuning the charge on these plates until the weight of the oil drop is balanced by the electric forces, the net charge on the oil drop can be determined quite precisely. The oil-drop experiment involved spraying a fine mist of oil between two metal plates charged with opposite charges. By knowing the mass of the oil droplets and adjusting the electric charge on the plates, the charge on the oil drops can be determined with precision. Millikan and Fletcher found that the drops would accumulate charge in discrete units of about −1.59× 10 −19 C, which is within 1 percent of the modern value of −1.60× 10 −19 C. Although this difference may seem quite small, it is actually five times greater than the possible error Millikan reported for his results!Because the charge on the electron is a fundamental constant of nature, determining its precise value is very important for all of science. This created pressure on Millikan and others after him that reveals some equally important aspects of human nature. First, Millikan took sole credit for the experiment and was awarded the 1923 Nobel Prize in physics for this work, although his student Harvey Fletcher apparently contributed in significant ways to the work. Just before his death in 1981, Fletcher divulged that Millikan coerced him to give Millikan sole credit for the work, in exchange for which Millikan promoted Fletcher’s career at Bell Labs. Another great scientist, Richard Feynman, points out that many scientists who measured the fundamental charge after Millikan were reluctant to report values that differed much from Millikan’s value. History shows that later measurements slowly crept up from Millikan’s value until settling on the modern value. Why did they not immediately find the error and correct the value, asks Feynman. Apparently, having found a value higher than the much-respected value found by Millikan, scientists would look for possible mistakes that might lower their value to make it agree better with Millikan’s value. This reveals the important psychological weight carried by preconceived notions and shows how hard it is to refute them. Scientists, however devoted to logic and data they may be, are apparently just as vulnerable to this aspect of human nature as everyone else. The lesson here is that, although it is good to be skeptical of new results, you should not discount them just because they do not agree with conventional wisdom. If your reasoning is sound and your data are reliable, the conclusion demanded by the data must be seriously considered, even if that conclusion disagrees with the commonly accepted truth. Suppose that Millikan observed an oil drop carrying three fundamental units of charge. What would be the net charge on this oil drop? −4.81 × 10−19 C −1.602 × 10−19 C 1.602 × 10−19 C 4.81 × 10−19 C Like and Unlike Charges This activity investigates the repulsion and attraction caused by static electrical charge. Adhesive tape Nonconducting surface, such as a plastic table or chair Instructions Procedure for Part (a) Prepare two pieces of tape about 4 cm long. To make a handle, double over about 0.5 cm at one end so that the sticky side sticks together. Attach the pieces of tape side by side onto a nonmetallic surface, such as a tabletop or the seat of a chair, as shown in (a). Peel off both pieces of tape and hang them downward, holding them by the handles, as shown in (b). If the tape bends upward and sticks to your hand, try using a shorter piece of tape, or simply shake the tape so that it no longer sticks to your hand. Now slowly bring the two pieces of tape together, as shown in (c). What happens? Procedure for Part (b) Stick one piece of tape on the nonmetallic surface, and stick the second piece of tape on top of the first piece, as shown in (a). Slowly peel off the two pieces by pulling on the handle of the bottom piece. Gently stroke your finger along the top of the second piece of tape (i.e., the nonsticky side), as shown in (b). Peel the two pieces of tape apart by pulling on their handles, as shown in (c). Slowly bring the two pieces of tape together. What happens? In step 4, why did the two pieces of tape repel each other? In step 9, why did they attract each other? Like charges attract, while unlike charges repel each other. Like charges repel, while unlike charges attract each other. Tapes having positive charge repel, while tapes having negative charge attract each other. Tapes having negative charge repel, while tapes having positive charge attract each other. Conservation of Charge Teacher Support [BL][OL]Discuss what is meant by conservation in the physics sense. Point out how conservation laws serve as accounting rules that allow us to keep track of certain quantities. This is similar to knowing how many students are on a field trip and using that information to ensure that no students go missing. Because students cannot vanish into thin air, counting the students allows the teacher to know whether any students are not present. If they are not present, then they must be elsewhere, and a search can begin. [AL]Ask what other laws of conservation they have encountered in physics, and discuss how these laws are used. Because the fundamental positive and negative units of charge are carried on protons and electrons, we would expect that the total charge cannot change in any system that we define. In other words, although we might be able to move charge around, we cannot create or destroy it. This should be true provided that we do not create or destroy protons or electrons in our system. In the twentieth century, however, scientists learned how to create and destroy electrons and protons, but they found that charge is still conserved. Many experiments and solid theoretical arguments have elevated this idea to the status of a law. The law of conservation of charge says that electrical charge cannot be created or destroyed. The law of conservation of charge is very useful. It tells us that the net charge in a system is the same before and after any interaction within the system. Of course, we must ensure that no external charge enters the system during the interaction and that no internal charge leaves the system. Mathematically, conservation of charge can be expressed as q initial = q final . where q initial is the net charge of the system before the interaction, and q final, is the net charge after the interaction.What is the missing charge? shows two spheres that initially have +4 C and +8 C of charge. After an interaction (which could simply be that they touch each other), the blue sphere has +10 C of charge, and the red sphere has an unknown quantity of charge. Use the law of conservation of charge to find the final charge on the red sphere. Strategy The net initial charge of the system is q initial =+4C+8C=+12C . The net final charge of the system is q final =+10C+ q red , where q red is the final charge on the red sphere. Conservation of charge tells us that q initial = q final , so we can solve for q red . Solution Equating q initial and q final and solving for q red gives q initial = q final +12C = +10C+ q red. +2C = q red. The red sphere has +2 C of charge. Two spheres, one blue and one red, initially have +4 C and +8 C of charge, respectively. After the two spheres interact, the blue sphere has a charge of +10 C. The law of conservation of charge allows us to find the final charge q red on the red sphere. Discussion Like all conservation laws, conservation of charge is an accounting scheme that helps us keep track of electric charge. Practice Problems Which equation describes conservation of charge? qinitial = qfinal = constant qinitial = qfinal = 0 qinitial − qfinal = 0 qinitial/qfinal = constant Conductors and Insulators Teacher Support [BL]Have students define the meaning of conductor and insulator. Explain how these terms are used in physics to mean materials that allow a quantity to pass through and those that do not. [OL]Ask students whether they have encountered conductors and insulators in their everyday lives. What are the properties of these materials? Be prepared to discuss and differentiate thermal conductors and insulators. [AL]Ask whether students recall other conductors and insulators in physics. Discuss how thermal insulators and conductors function with regard to thermal energy. Materials can be classified depending on whether they allow charge to move. If charge can easily move through a material, such as metals, then these materials are called conductors. This means that charge can be conducted (i.e., move) through the material rather easily. If charge cannot move through a material, such as rubber, then this material is called an insulator. Most materials are insulators. Their atoms and molecules hold on more tightly to their electrons, so it is difficult for electrons to move between atoms. However, it is not impossible. With enough energy, it is possible to force electrons to move through an insulator. However, the insulator is often physically destroyed in the process. In metals, the outer electrons are loosely bound to their atoms, so not much energy is required to make electrons move through metal. Such metals as copper, silver, and aluminum are good conductors. Insulating materials include plastics, glass, ceramics, and wood. The conductivity of some materials is intermediate between conductors and insulators. These are called semiconductors. They can be made conductive under the right conditions, which can involve temperature, the purity of the material, and the force applied to push electrons through them. Because we can control whether semiconductors are conductors or insulators, these materials are used extensively in computer chips. The most commonly used semiconductor is silicon. shows various materials arranged according to their ability to conduct electrons. Materials can be arranged according to their ability to conduct electric charge. The slashes on the arrow mean that there is a very large gap in conducting ability between conductors, semiconductors, and insulators, but the drawing is compressed to fit on the page. The numbers below the materials give their resistivity in Ω•m (which you will learn about below). The resistivity is a measure of how hard it is to make charge move through a given material. Teacher Support Point out that the scale is not linear, which means that the conductivity of the insulators is much, much less than that of conductors. Also point out that semiconductors are often made to act as insulators or as conductors, but not as materials with a conductivity that is between that of insulators and conductors. What happens if an excess negative charge is placed on a conducting object? Because like charges repel each other, they will push against each other until they are as far apart as they can get. Because the charge can move in a conductor, it moves to the outer surfaces of the object. (a) shows schematically how an excess negative charge spreads itself evenly over the outer surface of a metal sphere. What happens if the same is done with an insulating object? The electrons still repel each other, but they are not able to move, because the material is an insulator. Thus, the excess charge stays put and does not distribute itself over the object. (b) shows this situation. (a) A conducting sphere with excess negative charge (i.e., electrons). The electrons repel each other and spread out to cover the outer surface of the sphere. (b) An insulating sphere with excess negative charge. The electrons cannot move, so they remain in their original positions. Teacher Support Point out that static buildup does not remain forever on an object. Ask students how a static charge may escape from an object. Point out that this static buildup is dissipated faster on humid days than on dry days. Transfer and Separation of Charge Teacher Support [BL][OL]Ask how the concept of static electricity can be compatible with transfer of charge. Isn’t transfer of charge the movement of charge, which contradicts being static? [AL]Ask students to define separation of charge. Prepare to explain why this does not mean splitting electrons apart. Most objects we deal with are electrically neutral, which means that they have the same amount of positive and negative charge. However, transferring negative charge from one object to another is fairly easy to do. When negative charge is transferred from one object to another, an excess of positive charge is left behind. How do we know that the negative charge is the mobile charge? The positive charge is carried by the proton, which is stuck firmly in the nucleus of atoms, and the atoms are stuck in place in solid materials. Electrons, which carry the negative charge, are much easier to remove from their atoms or molecules and can therefore be transferred more easily. Electric charge can be transferred in several manners. One of the simplest ways to transfer charge is charging by contact, in which the surfaces of two objects made of different materials are placed in close contact. If one of the materials holds electrons more tightly than the other, then it takes some electrons with it when the materials are separated. Rubbing two surfaces together increases the transfer of electrons, because it creates a closer contact between the materials. It also serves to present fresh material with a full supply of electrons to the other material. Thus, when you walk across a carpet on a dry day, your shoes rub against the carpet, and some electrons are removed from the carpet by your shoes. The result is that you have an excess of negative charge on your shoes. When you then touch a doorknob, some of your excess of electrons transfer to the neutral doorknob, creating a small spark. Touching the doorknob with your hand demonstrates a second way to transfer electric charge, which is charging by conduction. This transfer happens because like charges repel, and so the excess electrons that you picked up from the carpet want to be as far away from each other as possible. Some of them move to the doorknob, where they will distribute themselves over the outer surface of the metal. Another example of charging by conduction is shown in the top row of . A metal sphere with 100 excess electrons touches a metal sphere with 50 excess electrons, so 25 electrons from the first sphere transfer to the second sphere. Each sphere finishes with 75 excess electrons.The same reasoning applies to the transfer of positive charge. However, because positive charge essentially cannot move in solids, it is transferred by moving negative charge in the opposite direction. For example, consider the bottom row of . The first metal sphere has 100 excess protons and touches a metal sphere with 50 excess protons, so the second sphere transfers 25 electrons to the first sphere. These 25 extra electrons will electrically cancel 25 protons so that the first metal sphere is left with 75 excess protons. This is shown in the bottom row of . The second metal sphere lost 25 electrons so it has 25 more excess protons, for a total of 75 excess protons. The end result is the same if we consider that the first ball transferred a net positive charge equal to that of 25 protons to the first ball. In the top row, a metal sphere with 100 excess electrons transfers 25 electrons to a metal sphere with an excess of 50 electrons. After the transfer, both spheres have 75 excess electrons. In the bottom row, a metal sphere with 100 excess protons receives 25 electrons from a ball with 50 excess protons. After the transfer, both spheres have 75 excess protons. Teacher Support Point out how the total charge at each instant is the same. Discuss how moving electrons to the right is equivalent to moving the same magnitude of positive charge to the left, but be sure to clarify that, in most situations, only negative charges actually move in solids. [BL][OL]Discuss the meaning of polarization in everyday language. For example, discuss what is meant by a polarizing debate or a polarized Congress. Compare and contrast the everyday meaning with the physics meaning. [AL]Ask what other examples of polarization they can think of from everyday life. In this discussion, you may wonder how the excess electrons originally got from your shoes to your hand to create the spark when you touched the doorknob. The answer is that no electrons actually traveled from your shoes to your hands. Instead, because like charges repel each other, the excess electrons on your shoe simply pushed away some of the electrons in your feet. The electrons thus dislodged from your feet moved up into your leg and in turn pushed away some electrons in your leg. This process continued through your whole body until a distribution of excess electrons covered the extremities of your body. Thus your head, your hands, the tip of your nose, and so forth all received their doses of excess electrons that had been pushed out of their normal positions. All this was the result of electrons being pushed out of your feet by the excess electrons on your shoes. This type of charge separation is called polarization. As soon as the excess electrons leave your shoes (by rubbing off onto the floor or being carried away in humid air), the distribution of electrons in your body returns to normal. Every part of your body is again electrically neutral (i.e., zero excess charge). The phenomenon of polarization is seen in . The child has accumulated excess positive charge by sliding on the slide. This excess charge repels itself and so becomes distributed over the extremities of the child’s body, notably in his hair. As a result, the hair stands on end, because the excess negative charge on each strand repels the excess negative charge on neighboring strands.Polarization can be used to charge objects. Consider the two metallic spheres shown in . The spheres are electrically neutral, so they carry the same amounts of positive and negative charge. In the top picture ((a)), the two spheres are touching, and the positive and negative charge is evenly distributed over the two spheres. We then approach a glass rod that carries an excess positive charge, which can be done by rubbing the glass rod with silk, as shown in (b). Because opposite charges attract each other, the negative charge is attracted to the glass rod, leaving an excess positive charge on the opposite side of the right sphere. This is an example of charging by induction, whereby a charge is created by approaching a charged object with a second object to create an unbalanced charge in the second object. If we then separate the two spheres, as shown in (c), the excess charge is stuck on each sphere. The left sphere now has an excess negative charge, and the right sphere has an excess positive charge. Finally, in the bottom picture, the rod is removed, and the opposite charges attract each other, so they move as close together as they can get. (a) Two neutral conducting spheres are touching each other, so the charge is evenly spread over both spheres. (b) A positively charged rod approaches, which attracts negative charges, leaving excess positive charge on the right sphere. (c) The spheres are separated. Each sphere now carries an equal magnitude of excess charge. (d) When the positively charged rod is removed, the excess negative charge on the left sphere is attracted to the excess positive charge on the right sphere.

Create a Spark in a Science Fair Van de Graaff generators are devices that are used not only for serious physics research but also for demonstrating the physics of static electricity at science fairs and in classrooms. Because they deliver relatively little electric current, they can be made safe for use in such environments. The first such generator was built by Robert Van de Graaff in 1931 for use in nuclear physics research. shows a simplified sketch of a Van de Graaff generator. Van de Graaff generators use smooth and pointed surfaces and conductors and insulators to generate large static charges. In the version shown in , electrons are “sprayed” from the tips of the lower comb onto a moving belt, which is made of an insulating material like, such as rubber. This technique of charging the belt is akin to charging your shoes with electrons by walking across a carpet. The belt raises the charges up to the upper comb, where they transfer again, akin to your touching the doorknob and transferring your charge to it. Because like charges repel, the excess electrons all rush to the outer surface of the globe, which is made of metal (a conductor). Thus, the comb itself never accumulates too much charge, because any charge it gains is quickly depleted by the charge moving to the outer surface of the globe. Van de Graaff generators transfer electrons onto a metallic sphere, where the electrons distribute themselves uniformly over the outer surface.Van de Graaff generators are used to demonstrate many interesting effects caused by static electricity. By touching the globe, a person gains excess charge, so his or her hair stands on end, as shown in . You can also create mini lightning bolts by moving a neutral conductor toward the globe. Another favorite is to pile up aluminum muffin tins on top of the uncharged globe, then turn on the generator. Being made of conducting material, the tins accumulate excess charge. They then repel each other and fly off the globe one by one. A quick Internet search will show many examples of what you can do with a Van de Graaff generator. The man touching the Van de Graaff generator has excess charge, which spreads over his hair and repels hair strands from his neighbors. (credit: Jon “ShakataGaNai” Davis) Why don’t the electrons stay on the rubber belt when they reach the upper comb? The upper comb has no excess electrons, and the excess electrons in the rubber belt get transferred to the comb by contact. The upper comb has no excess electrons, and the excess electrons in the rubber belt get transferred to the comb by conduction. The upper comb has excess electrons, and the excess electrons in the rubber belt get transferred to the comb by conduction. The upper comb has excess electrons, and the excess electrons in the rubber belt get transferred to the comb by contact. Balloons and Static Electricity This simulation allows you to observe negative charge accumulating on a balloon as you rub it against a sweater. You can then observe how two charged balloons interact and how they cause polarization in a wall. Click the reset button, and start with two balloons. Charge a first balloon by rubbing it on the sweater, and then move it toward the second balloon. Why does the second balloon not move? The second balloon has an equal number of positive and negative charges. The second balloon has more positive charges than negative charges. The second balloon has more negative charges than positive charges. The second balloon is positively charged and has polarization.

Charging Ink Droplets Electrically neutral ink droplets in an ink-jet printer pass through an electron beam created by an electron gun, as shown in . Some electrons are captured by the ink droplet, so that it becomes charged. After passing through the electron beam, the net charge of the ink droplet is q inkdrop =−1× 10 −10 C . How many electrons are captured by the ink droplet? Electrons from an electron gun charge a passing ink droplet. Strategy A single electron carries a charge of q e − =−1.602× 10 −19 C . Dividing the net charge of the ink droplet by the charge q e − of a single electron will give the number of electrons captured by the ink droplet. Solution The number n of electrons captured by the ink droplet are n= q inkdrop q e − = −1× 10 −10 C −1.602× 10 −19 C =6× 10 8 . Discussion This is almost a billion electrons! It seems like a lot, but it is quite small compared to the number of atoms in an ink droplet, which number about 10 16 . Thus, each extra electron is shared between about 10 16 / ( 6× 10 8 ) ≈ 10 7 atoms.

Electric charge comes in two varieties, which are called positive and negative. Charges with the same sign repel each other. Charges with opposite signs attract each other. Charges can move easily in conducting material. Charges cannot move easily in an insulating material. Objects can be charged in three ways: by contact, by conduction, and by induction. Although a polarized object may be neutral, its electrical charge is unbalanced, so one side of the object has excess negative charge and the other side has an equal magnitude of excess positive charge.

The student is expected to: (C) describe and calculate how the magnitude of the electrical force between two objects depends on their charges and the distance between them. Section Key Terms Coulomb’s law inverse-square law Teacher Support This section presents Coulomb’s law and points out its similarities and differences with respect to Newton’s law of universal gravitation. The similarities include the inverse-square nature of the two laws and the analogous roles of mass and charge. The differences include the restriction of positive mass versus positive or negative charge. [BL][OL]Discuss how Coulomb described this law long after Newton described the law of universal gravitation. [AL]Ask why the law of force between electrostatic charge was discovered after that of gravity if gravity is weak compared to electrostatic forces. More than 100 years before Thomson and Rutherford discovered the fundamental particles that carry positive and negative electric charges, the French scientist Charles-Augustin de Coulomb mathematically described the force between charged objects. Doing so required careful measurements of forces between charged spheres, for which he built an ingenious device called a torsion balance. This device, shown in , contains an insulating rod that is hanging by a thread inside a glass-walled enclosure. At one end of the rod is the metallic sphere A. When no charge is on this sphere, it touches sphere B. Coulomb would touch the spheres with a third metallic ball (shown at the bottom of the diagram) that was charged. An unknown amount of charge would distribute evenly between spheres A and B, which would then repel each other, because like charges repel. This force would cause sphere A to rotate away from sphere B, thus twisting the wire until the torsion in the wire balanced the electrical force. Coulomb then turned the knob at the top, which allowed him to rotate the thread, thus bringing sphere A closer to sphere B. He found that bringing sphere A twice as close to sphere B required increasing the torsion by a factor of four. Bringing the sphere three times closer required a ninefold increase in the torsion. From this type of measurement, he deduced that the electrical force between the spheres was inversely proportional to the distance squared between the spheres. In other words, F∝ 1 r 2, where r is the distance between the spheres. An electrical charge distributes itself equally between two conducting spheres of the same size. Knowing this allowed Coulomb to divide an unknown charge in half. Repeating this process would produce a sphere with one quarter of the initial charge, and so on. Using this technique, he measured the force between spheres A and B when they were charged with different amounts of charge. These measurements led him to deduce that the force was proportional to the charge on each sphere, or F∝ q A q B, where q A is the charge on sphere A, and q B is the charge on sphere B. A drawing of Coulomb’s torsion balance, which he used to measure the electrical force between charged spheres. (credit: Charles-Augustin de Coulomb)Combining these two proportionalities, he proposed the following expression to describe the force between the charged spheres. F= k q 1 q 2 r 2 This equation is known as Coulomb’s law, and it describes the electrostatic force between charged objects. The constant of proportionality k is called Coulomb’s constant. In SI units, the constant k has the value k=8.99× 10 9 N⋅ m 2 /C 2. The direction of the force is along the line joining the centers of the two objects. If the two charges are of opposite signs, Coulomb’s law gives a negative result. This means that the force between the particles is attractive. If the two charges have the same signs, Coulomb’s law gives a positive result. This means that the force between the particles is repulsive. For example, if both q 1 and q 2 are negative or if both are positive, the force between them is repulsive. This is shown in (a). If q 1 is a negative charge and q 2 is a positive charge (or vice versa), then the charges are different, so the force between them is attractive. This is shown in (b). The magnitude of the electrostatic force F between point charges q1 and q2 separated by a distance r is given by Coulomb’s law. Note that Newton’s third law (every force exerted creates an equal and opposite force) applies as usual—the force (F1,2) on q1 is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force (F2,1) it exerts on q2. (a) Like charges. (b) Unlike charges. Teacher Support Point out how the subscripts 1, 2 means the force on object 1 due to object 2 (and vice versa). Note that Coulomb’s law applies only to charged objects that are not moving with respect to each other. The law says that the force is proportional to the amount of charge on each object and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the objects. If we double the charge q 1 , for instance, then the force is doubled. If we double the distance between the objects, then the force between them decreases by a factor of 2 2 =4 . Although Coulomb’s law is true in general, it is easiest to apply to spherical objects or to objects that are much smaller than the distance between the objects (in which case, the objects can be approximated as spheres). Coulomb’s law is an example of an inverse-square law, which means the force depends on the square of the denominator. Another inverse-square law is Newton’s law of universal gravitation, which is F= G m 1 m 2 / r 2 . Although these laws are similar, they differ in two important respects: (i) The gravitational constant G is much, much smaller than k ( G=6.67× 10 −11 m 3 /kg⋅ s 2 ); and (ii) only one type of mass exists, whereas two types of electric charge exist. These two differences explain why gravity is so much weaker than the electrostatic force and why gravity is only attractive, whereas the electrostatic force can be attractive or repulsive. Finally, note that Coulomb measured the distance between the spheres from the centers of each sphere. He did not explain this assumption in his original papers, but it turns out to be valid. From outside a uniform spherical distribution of charge, it can be treated as if all the charge were located at the center of the sphere. Electrostatics (part 1): Introduction to charge and Coulomb's law This video explains the basics of Coulomb’s law. Note that the lecturer uses d for the distance between the center of the particles instead of r. True or false—If one particle carries a positive charge and another carries a negative charge, then the force between them is attractive. true false Hovering plastic In this lab, you will use electrostatics to hover a thin piece of plastic in the air. Balloon Light plastic bag (e.g., produce bag from grocery store) Instructions Procedure Cut the plastic bag to make a plastic loop about 2 inches wide. Inflate the balloon. Charge the balloon by rubbing it on your clothes. Charge the plastic loop by placing it on a nonmetallic surface and rubbing it with a cloth. Hold the balloon in one hand, and in the other hand hold the plastic loop above the balloon. If the loop clings too much to your hand, recruit a friend to hold the strip above the balloon with both hands. Now let go of the plastic loop, and maneuver the balloon under the plastic loop to keep it hovering in the air above the balloon. How does the balloon keep the plastic loop hovering? The balloon and the loop are both negatively charged. This will help the balloon keep the plastic loop hovering. The balloon is charged, while the plastic loop is neutral.This will help the balloon keep the plastic loop hovering. The balloon and the loop are both positively charged. This will help the balloon keep the plastic loop hovering. The balloon is positively charged, while the plastic loop is negatively charged. This will help the balloon keep the plastic loop hovering. Using Coulomb’s law to find the force between charged objects Suppose Coulomb measures a force of 20× 10 −6 N between the two charged spheres when they are separated by 5.0 cm. By turning the dial at the top of the torsion balance, he approaches the spheres so that they are separated by 3.0 cm. Which force does he measure now? Strategy Apply Coulomb’s law to the situation before and after the spheres are brought closer together. Although we do not know the charges on the spheres, we do know that they remain the same. We call these unknown but constant charges q 1 and q 2 . Because these charges appear as a product in Coulomb’s law, they form a single unknown. We thus have two equations and two unknowns, which we can solve. The first unknown is the force (which we call F f ) when the spheres are 3.0 cm apart, and the second is q 1 q 2 . Use the following notation: When the charges are 5.0 cm apart, the force is F i =20× 10 −6 N and r i =5.0cm=0.050m , where the subscript i means initial. Once the charges are brought closer together, we know r f =3.0cm=0.030m , where the subscript f means final. Solution Coulomb’s law applied to the spheres in their initial positions gives F i = k q 1 q 2 r i 2. . Coulomb’s law applied to the spheres in their final positions gives F f = k q 1 q 2 r f 2. . Dividing the second equation by the first and solving for the final force F f leads to F f F i = k q 1 q 2 / r f 2 k q 1 q 2 / r i 2 . = r i 2 r f 2 F f = F i r i 2 r f 2 . Inserting the known quantities yields F f = F i r i 2 r f 2 = ( 20× 10 −6 N ) ( 0.050m ) 2 ( 0.030m ) 2 = 56× 10 −6 N = 5.6× 10 −5 N. The force acts along the line joining the centers of the spheres. Because the same type of charge is on each sphere, the force is repulsive. Discussion As expected, the force between the charges is greater when they are 3.0 cm apart than when they are 5.0 cm apart. Note that although it is a good habit to convert cm to m (because the constant k is in SI units), it is not necessary in this problem, because the distances cancel out. We can also solve for the second unknown | q 1 q 2 | . By using the first equation, we find F f = k q 1 q 2 r i 2 q 1 q 2 = F i r i 2 k = ( 20× 10 −6 N ) ( 0.050m ) 2 8.99× 10 9 N⋅ m 2 /C 2 = 5.6× 10 −18 C 2 Note how the units cancel in the second-to-last line. Had we not converted cm to m, this would not occur, and the result would be incorrect. Finally, because the charge on each sphere is the same, we can further deduce that q 1 = q 2 =± 5.6× 10 −18 C 2 =±2.4nC. Using Coulomb’s law to find the distance between charged objects An engineer measures the force between two ink drops by measuring their acceleration and their diameter. She finds that each member of a pair of ink drops exerts a repulsive force of F=5.5mN on its partner. If each ink drop carries a charge q inkdrop =−1× 10 −10 C , how far apart are the ink drops? Strategy We know the force and the charge on each ink drop, so we can solve Coulomb’s law for the distance r between the ink drops. Do not forget to convert the force into SI units: F=5.5mN=5.5× 10 −3 N. Solution The charges in Coulomb’s law are q 1 = q 2 = q inkdrop , so the numerator in Coulomb’s law takes the form q 1 q 2 = q inkdrop 2 . Inserting this into Coulomb’s law and solving for the distance r gives F = k q inkdrop 2 r 2 r = ± k q inkdrop 2 F = ± ( 8.99× 10 9 N⋅ m 2 /C 2 ) ( −1× 10 −10 C ) 2 5.5× 10 −3 N = ±1.3× 10 −4 m or 130 microns (about one-tenth of a millimeter). Discussion The plus-minus sign means that we do not know which ink drop is to the right and which is to the left, but that is not important, because both ink drops are the same. Practice Problems A charge of −4 × 10−9 C is a distance of 3 cm from a charge of 3 × 10−9 C .

If the distance between them triples, what is the force between the charges? 0.22 N 0.67 N 2.0 N 18.0 N Check Your Understanding Why is Coulomb’s law called an inverse-square law? because the force is proportional to the inverse of the distance squared between charges because the force is proportional to the product of two charges because the force is proportional to the inverse of the product of two charges because the force is proportional to the distance squared between charges Section Summary Coulomb’s law is an inverse square law and describes the electrostatic force between particles. The electrostatic force between charged objects is proportional to the charge on each object and inversely proportional to the distance squared between the objects. If Coulomb’s law gives a negative result, the force is attractive; if the result is positive, the force is repulsive. Key Equations Coulomb’s law F= k q 1 q 2 r 2 Concept Items Two plastic spheres with uniform charge repel each other with a force of 10 N . If you remove the charge from one sphere, what will be the force between the spheres? The force will be 15 N. The force will be 10 N. The force will be 5 N. The force will be zero (or nearly zero). What creates a greater magnitude of force, two charges +q a distance r apart or two charges – q the same distance apart? Two charges +q a distance r away Two charges −q a distance r away The magnitudes of forces are equal. In Newton’s law of universal gravitation, the force between two masses is proportional to the product of the two masses. What plays the role of mass in Coulomb’s law? the electric charge the electric dipole the electric monopole the electric quadruple Critical Thinking In terms of Coulomb’s law, why are water molecules attracted by positive and negative charges? Water molecules are neutral. Water molecules have a third type of charge that is attracted by positive as well as negative charges. Water molecules are polar. Water molecule have either an excess of electrons or an excess of protons. Problems Two plastic spheres with uniform charge repel each other with a force of 10 N.

What is the force on the middle charge? −5.6 × 10−4 N to the left −1.12 × 10−4 N to the left +1.12 × 10−4 N to the right 5.6 × 10−4 N to the right Test Prep Multiple Choice If you double the distance between two point charges, by which factor does the force between the particles change? 1/2 2 4 1/4 The combined charge of all the electrons in a dime is hundreds of thousands of coulombs.

The dime has fewer protons than electrons, with positive charge. The dime is polarized, with electrons on one side and protons on the other side. Test Prep Short Answer The force between two charges is 4 × 10–9 N .

Newton’s gravitational constant is G = 6.67 × 10−11 m3/kg⋅s2. This tells you about the relative strength of the electrostatic force versus that of gravity. true false An atomic nucleus contains 56 protons, for iron. Which force would this nucleus apply on an electron at a distance of 10×10–12 m? 0.65 × 10–4 N 0.02 × 10–4 N 1.3 × 10–4 N 72.8 × 10–4 N Test Prep Extended Response Electrostatic forces are enormous compared to gravitational force. Why do you not notice electrostatic forces in everyday life, whereas you do notice the force due to gravity? Because there are two types of charge, but only one type of mass exists. Because there is only one type of charge, but two types of mass exist. Because opposite charges cancel each other, while gravity does not cancel out. Because opposite charges do not cancel each other, while gravity cancels out. A small metal sphere with a net charge of 3.0 nC is touched to a second small metal sphere that is initially neutral. The spheres are then placed 20 cm apart.

The student is expected to: (C) describe and calculate how the magnitude of the electrical force between two objects depends on their charges and the distance between them. Section Key Terms electric field test charge Teacher Support Ask students whether they have seen movies that use the concept of fields as in force fields. Have them describe how such fields work. Describe how gravity can be thought of as a field that surrounds a mass and with which other masses interact. Explain that electric fields are very similar to gravitational fields. You may have heard of a force field in science fiction movies, where such fields apply forces at particular positions in space to keep a villain trapped or to protect a spaceship from enemy fire. The concept of a field is very useful in physics, although it differs somewhat from what you see in movies. A field is a way of conceptualizing and mapping the force that surrounds any object and acts on another object at a distance without apparent physical connection. For example, the gravitational field surrounding Earth and all other masses represents the gravitational force that would be experienced if another mass were placed at a given point within the field. Michael Faraday, an English physicist of the nineteenth century, proposed the concept of an electric field. If you know the electric field, then you can easily calculate the force (magnitude and direction) applied to any electric charge that you place in the field. An electric field is generated by electric charge and tells us the force per unit charge at all locations in space around a charge distribution. The charge distribution could be a single point charge; a distribution of charge over, say, a flat plate; or a more complex distribution of charge. The electric field extends into space around the charge distribution. Now consider placing a test charge in the field. A test charge is a positive electric charge whose charge is so small that it does not significantly disturb the charges that create the electric field. The electric field exerts a force on the test charge in a given direction. The force exerted is proportional to the charge of the test charge. For example, if we double the charge of the test charge, the force exerted on it doubles. Mathematically, saying that electric field is the force per unit charge is written as E → = F → q test where we are considering only electric forces. Note that the electric field is a vector field that points in the same direction as the force on the positive test charge. The units of electric field are N/C. If the electric field is created by a point charge or a sphere of uniform charge, then the magnitude of the force between this point charge Q and the test charge is given by Coulomb’s law F= k| Q q test | r 2 where the absolute value is used, because we only consider the magnitude of the force. The magnitude of the electric field is then E= F q test = k| Q | r 2 . This equation gives the magnitude of the electric field created by a point charge Q. The distance r in the denominator is the distance from the point charge, Q, or from the center of a spherical charge, to the point of interest. If the test charge is removed from the electric field, the electric field still exists. To create a three-dimensional map of the electric field, imagine placing the test charge in various locations in the field. At each location, measure the force on the charge, and use the vector equation E → = F → / q test to calculate the electric field. Draw an arrow at each point where you place the test charge to represent the strength and the direction of the electric field. The length of the arrows should be proportional to the strength of the electric field. If you join together these arrows, you obtain lines. shows an image of the three-dimensional electric field created by a positive charge. Three-dimensional representation of the electric field generated by a positive charge. Teacher Support [BL][OL]Point out that all electric field lines originate from the charge. [AL]Point out that the number of lines crossing an imaginary sphere surrounding the charge is the same no matter what size sphere you choose. Ask whether students can use this to show that the number of field lines crossing a surface per unit area shows that the electric field strength decreases as the inverse square of the distance. Just drawing the electric field lines in a plane that slices through the charge gives the two-dimensional electric-field maps shown in . On the left is the electric field created by a positive charge, and on the right is the electric field created by a negative charge. Notice that the electric field lines point away from the positive charge and toward the negative charge. Thus, a positive test charge placed in the electric field of the positive charge will be repelled. This is consistent with Coulomb’s law, which says that like charges repel each other. If we place the positive charge in the electric field of the negative charge, the positive charge is attracted to the negative charge. The opposite is true for negative test charges. Thus, the direction of the electric field lines is consistent with what we find by using Coulomb’s law. The equation E= k| Q |/ r 2 says that the electric field gets stronger as we approach the charge that generates it. For example, at 2 cm from the charge Q (r = 2 cm), the electric field is four times stronger than at 4 cm from the charge (r = 4 cm). Looking at and again, we see that the electric field lines become denser as we approach the charge that generates it. In fact, the density of the electric field lines is proportional to the strength of the electric field! Electric field lines from two point charges. The red point on the left carries a charge of +1 nC, and the blue point on the right carries a charge of –1 nC. The arrows point in the direction that a positive test charge would move. The field lines are denser as you approach the point charge. Electric-field maps can be made for several charges or for more complicated charge distributions. The electric field due to multiple charges may be found by adding together the electric field from each individual charge. Because this sum can only be a single number, we know that only a single electric-field line can go through any given point. In other words, electric-field lines cannot cross each other. (a) shows a two-dimensional map of the electric field generated by a charge of +q and a nearby charge of −q. The three-dimensional version of this map is obtained by rotating this map about the axis that goes through both charges. A positive test charge placed in this field would experience a force in the direction of the field lines at its location. It would thus be repelled from the positive charge and attracted to the negative charge. (b) shows the electric field generated by two charges of −q. Note how the field lines tend to repel each other and do not overlap. A positive test charge placed in this field would be attracted to both charges. If you are far from these two charges, where far means much farther than the distance between the charges, the electric field looks like the electric field from a single charge of −2q. (a) The electric field generated by a positive point charge (left) and a negative point charge of the same magnitude (right). (b) The electric field generated by two equal negative charges. Teacher Support Ask students to interpret the electric field maps. Where is the field strongest? Where is the field weakest? In which direction is the field increasing or decreasing? Where is the field the most uniform? Can they verify that the magnitude of the charges is the same in a given panel? How does the field for the two negative charges differ from that of the positive and negative charges? Probing an Electric Field This simulation shows you the electric field due to charges that you place on the screen. Start by clicking the top checkbox in the options panel on the right-hand side to show the electric field. Drag charges from the buckets onto the screen, move them around, and observe the electric field that they form. To see more precisely the magnitude and direction of the electric field, drag an electric-field sensor, or E-field sensor from the bottom bucket, and move it around the screen. Electrostatics (part 2): Interpreting electric field This video explains how to calculate the electric field of a point charge and how to interpret electric-field maps in general. Note that the lecturer uses d for the distance between particles instead of r. Note that the point charges are infinitesimally small, so all their charges are focused at a point. When larger charged objects are considered, the distance between the objects must be measured between the center of the objects. True or false—If a point charge has electric field lines that point into it, the charge must be positive. true false What is the charge? Look at the drawing of the electric field in . What is the relative strength and sign of the three charges? Map of electric field due to three charged particles. Strategy We know the electric field extends out from positive charge and terminates on negative charge. We also know that the number of electric field lines that touch a charge is proportional to the charge. Charge 1 has 12 fields coming out of it. Charge 2 has six field lines going into it. Charge 3 has 12 field lines going into it. Solution The electric-field lines come out of charge 1, so it is a positive charge. The electric-field lines go into charges 2 and 3, so they are negative charges. The ratio of the charges is q 1 : q 2 : q 3 =+12:−6:−12 . Thus, magnitude of charges 1 and 3 is twice that of charge 2. Discussion Although we cannot determine the precise charge on each particle, we can get a lot of information from the electric field regarding the magnitude and sign of the charges and where the force on a test charge would be greatest (or least). Electric field from doorknob A doorknob, which can be taken to be a spherical metal conductor, acquires a static electricity charge of q=−1.5nC. What is the electric field 1.0 cm in front of the doorknob? The diameter of the doorknob is 5.0 cm. Strategy Because the doorknob is a conductor, the entire charge is distributed on the outside surface of the metal. In addition, because the doorknob is assumed to be perfectly spherical, the charge on the surface is uniformly distributed, so we can treat the doorknob as if all the charge were located at the center of the doorknob. The validity of this simplification will be proved in a later physics course. Now sketch the doorknob, and define your coordinate system. Use +x to indicate the outward direction perpendicular to the door, with x=0 at the center of the doorknob (as shown in the figure below). If the diameter of the doorknob is 5.0 cm, its radius is 2.5 cm. We want to know the electric field 1.0 cm from the surface of the doorknob, which is a distance r=2.5cm+1.0cm=3.5cm from the center of the doorknob. We can use the equation E= k| Q | r 2 to find the magnitude of the electric field. The direction of the electric field is determined by the sign of the charge, which is negative in this case. Solution Inserting the charge Q=−1.5nC=−1.5× 10 −9 C and the distance r=3.5cm=0.035m into the equation E= k| Q | r 2 gives E = k| Q | r 2 = ( 8.99× 10 9 N⋅ m 2 /C 2 )| −1.5× 10 −9 C | ( 0.035m ) 2 = 1.1× 10 4 N/C. Because the charge is negative, the electric-field lines point toward the center of the doorknob. Thus, the electric field at x=3.5cm is (−1.1× 10 4 N/C) x ^ . Discussion This seems like an enormous electric field. Luckily, it takes an electric field roughly 100 times stronger ( 3× 10 6 N/C ) to cause air to break down and conduct electricity. Also, the weight of an adult is about 70kg×9.8 m/s 2 ≈700N , so why don’t you feel a force on the protons in your hand as you reach for the doorknob? The reason is that your hand contains an equal amount of negative charge, which repels the negative charge in the doorknob. A very small force might develop from polarization in your hand, but you would never notice it. Practice Problems What is the magnitude of the electric field from 20 cm from a point charge of q = 33 nC? 7.4 × 103 N/C 1.48 × 103 N / C 7.4 × 1012 N / C 0 A −10 nC charge is at the origin. In which direction does the electric field from the charge point at x + 10 cm ? The electric field points away from negative charges. The electric field points toward negative charges. The electric field points toward positive charges. The electric field points away from positive charges. Check Your Understanding When electric field lines get closer together, what does that tell you about the electric field? The electric field is inversely proportional to the density of electric field lines. The electric field is directly proportional to the density of electric field lines. The electric field is not related to the density of electric field lines. The electric field is inversely proportional to the square root of density of electric field lines. If five electric-field lines come out of a +5 nC charge, how many electric-field lines should come out of a +20 nC charge? five field lines 10 field lines 15 field lines 20 field lines Section Summary The electric field defines the force per unit charge in the space around a charge distribution. For a point charge or a sphere of uniform charge, the electric field is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the point charge or from the center of the sphere. Electric-field lines never cross each other. More force is applied to a charge in a region with many electric field lines than in a region with few electric field lines. Electric field lines start at positive charges and point away from positive charges. They end at negative charges and point toward negative charges. Key Equations electric field E → = F → q test magnitude of electric field of point charge E= k| Q | r 2 Concept Items Why can electric fields not cross each other? Many electric-field lines can exist at any given point in space. No electric-field lines can exist at any given point in space. Only a single electric-field line can exist at any given point in space. Two electric-field lines can exist at the same point in space. A constant electric field is (4.5 × 105 N/C)ŷ. In which direction is the force on a −20 nC charge placed in this field? The direction of the force is in the + x ^ direction. The direction of the force is in the + x ^ direction. The direction of the force is in the −ŷ direction. The direction of the force is in the +ŷ direction. Critical Thinking An arbitrary electric field passes through a box-shaped volume. There are no charges in the box. If 11 electric-field lines enter the box, how many electric-field lines must exit the box? nine electric field lines 10 electric field lines 11 electric field lines 12 electric field lines In a science-fiction movie, a villain emits a radial electric field to repulse the hero. Knowing that the hero is electrically neutral, is this possible? Explain your reasoning. No, because an electrically neutral body cannot be repelled or attracted. No, because an electrically neutral body can be attracted but not repelled. Yes, because an electrically neutral body can be repelled or attracted. Yes, because an electrically neutral body can be repelled. Problems An electric field (15 N/C)ẑ applies a force (− 3 × 10–6 N)ẑ on a particle.

The student is expected to: (C) describe and calculate how the magnitude of the electrical force between two objects depends on their charges and the distance between them; and (D) identify examples of electric and magnetic forces in everyday life. Section Key Terms electric potential electric potential energy Teacher Support This section again uses the analogy between gravity and electric force to present electric potential energy and electric potential. [BL]Ask students to define how potential is used in everyday life. Draw the analogy between this and potential energy. [OL][AL]Review the concept of potential energy as being the potential an object has to do work by virtue of its position with respect to another object. [OL]Remind students that gravitational potential energy is only meaningful when we deal with differences in energy. In other words, a reference position is chosen, and all other potential energies are compared with the potential energy at the reference position. [AL]Point out that sometimes the reference position is at infinity, in which case this may not be explicitly stated. As you learned in studying gravity, a mass in a gravitational field has potential energy, which means it has the potential to accelerate and thereby increase its kinetic energy. This kinetic energy can be used to do work. For example, imagine you want to use a stone to pound a nail into a piece of wood. You first lift the stone high above the nail, which increases the potential energy of the stone-Earth system—because Earth is so large, it does not move, so we usually shorten this by saying simply that the potential energy of the stone increases. When you drop the stone, gravity converts the potential energy into kinetic energy. When the stone hits the nail, it does work by pounding the nail into the wood. The gravitational potential energy is the work that a mass can potentially do by virtue of its position in a gravitational field. Potential energy is a very useful concept, because it can be used with conservation of energy to calculate the motion of masses in a gravitational field. Electric potential energy works much the same way, but it is based on the electric field instead of the gravitational field. By virtue of its position in an electric field, a charge has an electric potential energy. If the charge is free to move, the force due to the electric field causes it to accelerate, so its potential energy is converted to kinetic energy, just like a mass that falls in a gravitational field. This kinetic energy can be used to do work. The electric potential energy is the work that a charge can do by virtue of its position in an electric field. The analogy between gravitational potential energy and electric potential energy is depicted in . On the left, the ball-Earth system gains gravitational potential energy when the ball is higher in Earth's gravitational field. On the right, the two-charge system gains electric potential energy when the positive charge is farther from the negative charge. On the left, the gravitational field points toward Earth. The higher the ball is in the gravitational field, the higher the potential energy is of the Earth-ball system. On the right, the electric field points toward a negative charge. The farther the positive charge is from the negative charge, the higher the potential energy is of the two-charge system.Let’s use the symbol U G to denote gravitational potential energy. When a mass falls in a gravitational field, its gravitational potential energy decreases. Conservation of energy tells us that the work done by the gravitational field to make the mass accelerate must equal the loss of potential energy of the mass. If we use the symbol W donebygravity to denote this work, then −Δ U G = W donebygravity, where the minus sign reflects the fact that the potential energy of the ball decreases. The work done by gravity on the mass is W donebygravity =−F( y f − y i ), where F is the force due to gravity, and y i and y f are the initial and final positions of the ball, respectively. The negative sign is because gravity points down, which we consider to be the negative direction. For the constant gravitational field near Earth’s surface, F=mg . The change in gravitational potential energy of the mass is −Δ U G = W donebygravity =−F( y f − y i )=−mg( y f − y i ) , or Δ U G =mg( y f − y i ). Note that y f − y i is just the negative of the height h from which the mass falls, so we usually just write Δ U G =−mgh . We now apply the same reasoning to a charge in an electric field to find the electric potential energy. The change Δ U E in electric potential energy is the work done by the electric field to move a charge q from an initial position x i to a final position x f ( −Δ U E = W donebyE-field ). The definition of work does not change, except that now the work is done by the electric field: W donebyE-field =F( x f − x i ) . For a charge that falls through a constant electric field E, the force applied to the charge by the electric field is F=qE . The change in electric potential energy of the charge is thus −Δ U E = W donebyE-field =Fd=qE( x f − x i ) or Δ U E =−qE( x f − x i ). This equation gives the change in electric potential energy of a charge q when it moves from position x i to position x f in a constant electric field E. shows how this analogy would work if we were close to Earth’s surface, where gravity is constant. The top image shows a charge accelerating due to a constant electric field. Likewise, the round mass in the bottom image accelerates due to a constant gravitation field. In both cases, the potential energy of the particle decreases, and its kinetic energy increases. In the top picture, a mass accelerates due to a constant electric field. In the bottom picture, the mass accelerates due to a constant gravitational field. Teacher Support Point out the fringing fields at the ends of the plates. Ask what path the charge would take if it were released in a fringing field (note that the charge does not follow the field lines due to its inertia). Ask students to draw the gravitational field lines in the bottom picture. Discuss why the mass does not follow the gravitational field lines. Analogy between Gravity and Electricity This video discusses the analogy between gravitational potential energy and electric potential energy. It reviews the concepts of work and potential energy and shows the connection between a mass in a uniform gravitation field, such as on Earth’s surface, and an electric charge in a uniform electric field. If the electric field is not constant, then the equation Δ U E =−qE( x f − x i ) is not valid, and deriving the electric potential energy becomes more involved. For example, consider the electric potential energy of an assembly of two point charges q 1 and q 2 of the same sign that are initially very far apart. We start by placing charge q 1 at the origin of our coordinate system. This takes no electrical energy, because there is no electric field at the origin (because charge q 2 is very far away). We then bring charge q 2 in from very far away to a distance r from the center of charge q 1 . This requires some effort, because the electric field of charge q 1 applies a repulsive force on charge q 2 . The energy it takes to assemble these two charges can be recuperated if we let them fly apart again. Thus, the charges have potential energy when they are a distance r apart. It turns out that the electric potential energy of a pair of point charges q 1 and q 2 a distance r apart is U E = k q 1 q 2 r To recap, if charges q 1 and q 2 are free to move, they can accumulate kinetic energy by flying apart, and this kinetic energy can be used to do work. The maximum amount of work the two charges can do (if they fly infinitely far from each other) is given by the equation above. Notice that if the two charges have opposite signs, then the potential energy is negative. This means that the charges have more potential to do work when they are far apart than when they are at a distance r apart. This makes sense: Opposite charges attract, so the charges can gain more kinetic energy if they attract each other from far away than if they start at only a short distance apart. Thus, they have more potential to do work when they are far apart. summarizes how the electric potential energy depends on charge and separation. The potential energy depends on the sign of the charges and their separation. The arrows on the charges indicate the direction in which the charges would move if released. When charges with the same sign are far apart, their potential energy is low, as shown in the top panel for two positive charges. The situation is the reverse for charges of opposite signs, as shown in the bottom panel. Teacher Support Have students imagine that they have to push together or pull apart balls that carry these charges. Discuss which would require more work: pushing them together from far apart or from close together. Compare this with the analogous situations for the different charge combinations and for pushing together versus pulling apart. Electric PotentialRecall that to find the force applied by a fixed charge Q on any arbitrary test charge q, it was convenient to define the electric field, which is the force per unit charge applied by Q on any test charge that we place in its electric field. The same Strategy is used here with electric potential energy: We now define the electric potential V, which is the electric potential energy per unit charge. V= U E q Teacher Support Emphasize the difference between electric potential energy and electric potential. Although the latter seems to be shorthand for the former, the two terms have different meanings. Normally, the electric potential is simply called the potential or voltage. The units for the potential are J/C, which are given the name volt (V) after the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta (1745–1827). From the equation U E = k q 1 q 2 /r , the electric potential a distance r from a point charge q 1 is V= U E q 2 = k q 1 r . This equation gives the energy required per unit charge to bring a charge q 2 from infinity to a distance r from a point charge q 1 . Mathematically, this is written as V= U E q 2 | R=r − U E q 2 | R=∞ . Note that this equation actually represents a difference in electric potential. However, because the second term is zero, it is normally not written, and we speak of the electric potential instead of the electric potential difference, or we just say the potential difference, or voltage). Below, when we consider the electric potential energy per unit charge between two points not infinitely far apart, we speak of electric potential difference explicitly. Just remember that electric potential and electric potential difference are really the same thing; the former is used just when the electric potential energy is zero in either the initial or final charge configuration. Coming back now to the electric potential a distance r from a point charge q 1 , note that q 1 can be any arbitrary point charge, so we can drop the subscripts and simply write V= kq r . Now consider the electric potential near a group of charges q1, q2, and q3, as drawn in . The electric potential is derived by considering the electric field. Electric fields follow the principle of superposition and can be simply added together, so the electric potential from different charges also add together. Thus, the electric potential of a point near a group of charges is V= k q 1 r 1 + k q 2 r 2 + k q 3 r 3 +⋯. where r 1 , r 2 , r 3 ,…, are the distances from the center of charges q 1 , q 2 , q 3 ,… to the point of interest, as shown in . The potential at the red point is simply the sum of the potentials due to each individual charge.Now let’s consider the electric potential in a uniform electric field. From the equation Δ U E =−qE( x f − x i ) , we see that the potential difference in going from x i to x f in a uniform electric field E is ΔV= Δ U E q =−E( x f − x i ) . Notice from the equation ΔV=−E( x f − x i ) that the electric field can be written as E= ΔV x f − x i which means that the electric field has units of V/m. Thus, if you know the potential difference between two points, calculating the electric field is very simple—you simply divide the potential difference by the distance! Notice that a positive charge in a region with high potential will experience a force pushing it toward regions of lower potential. In this sense, potential is like pressure for fluids. Imagine a pipe containing fluid, with the fluid at one end of the pipe under high pressure and the fluid at the other end of the pipe under low pressure. If nothing prevents the fluid from flowing, it will flow from the high-pressure end to the low-pressure end. Likewise, a positive charge that is free to move will move from a region with high potential to a region with lower potential. Voltage This video starts from electric potential energy and explains how this is related to electric potential (or voltage). The lecturer calculates the electric potential created by a uniform electric field. Electric Animals Many animals generate and/or detect electric fields. This is useful for activities such as hunting, defense, navigation, communication, and mating. Because salt water is a relatively good conductor, electric fish have evolved in all the world’s oceans. These fish have intrigued humans since the earliest times. In the nineteenth century, parties were even organized where the main attraction was getting a jolt from an electric fish! Scientists also studied electric fish to learn about electricity. Alessandro Volta based his research that led to batteries in 1799 on electric fish. He even referred to batteries as artificial electric organs, because he saw them as imitations of the electric organs of electric fish. Animals that generate electricity are called electrogenic and those that detect electric fields are called electroreceptive. Most fish that are electrogenic are also electroreceptive. One of the most well-known electric fish is the electric eel (see ), which is both electrogenic and electroreceptive. These fish have three pairs of organs that produce the electric charge: the main organ, Hunter’s organ, and Sach’s organ. Together, these organs account for more than 80percent of the fish’s body. Electric eels can produce electric discharges of much greater voltage than what you would get from a standard wall socket. These discharges can stun or even kill their prey. They also use low-intensity discharges to navigate. The electric fields they generate reflect off nearby obstacles or animals and are then detected by electroreceptors in the eel’s skin. The three organs that produce electricity contain electrolytes, which are substances that ionize when dissolved in water (or other liquids). An ionized atom or molecule is one that has lost or gained at least one electron, so it carries a net charge. Thus, a liquid solution containing an electrolyte conducts electricity, because the ions in the solution can move if an electric field is applied. To produce large discharges, the main organ is used. It contains approximately 6,000 rows of electroplaques connected in a long chain. Connected this way, the voltage between electroplaques adds up, creating a large final voltage. Each electroplaque consists of a column of cells controlled by an excitor nerve. When triggered by the excitor nerve, the electroplaques allow ionized sodium to flow through them, creating a potential difference between electroplaques. These potentials add up, and a large current can flow through the electrolyte. This geometry is reflected in batteries, which also use stacks of plates to produce larger potential differences. An electric eel in its natural environment. (credit: Steven G. Johnson) If an electric eel produces 1,000 V, which voltage is produced by each electroplaque in the main organ? 0.17 mV 1.7 mV 17 mV 170 mV X-ray Tube Dentists use X-rays to image their patients’ teeth and bones. The X-ray tubes that generate X-rays contain an electron source separated by about 10 cm from a metallic target. The electrons are accelerated from the source to the target by a uniform electric field with a magnitude of about 100 kN/C, as drawn in . When the electrons hit the target, X-rays are produced. (a) What is the potential difference between the electron source and the metallic target? (b) What is the kinetic energy of the electrons when they reach the target, assuming that the electrons start at rest? In an X-ray tube, a large current flows through the electron source, causing electrons to be ejected from the electron source. The ejected electrons are accelerated toward the target by the electric field. When they strike the target, X-rays are produced. Strategy FOR (A) Use the equation ΔV=−E( x f − x i ) to find the potential difference given a constant electric field. Define the source position as x i =0 and the target position as x f =10cm . To accelerate the electrons in the positive x direction, the electric field must point in the negative x direction. This way, the force F=qE on the electrons will point in the positive x direction, because both q and E are negative. Thus, E=−100× 10 3 N/C . Solution for (a) Using x i =0 and x f =10cm=0.10m , the equation ΔV=−E( x f − x i ) tells us that the potential difference between the electron source and the target is ΔV=−E( x f − x i )=−( −100× 10 3 N/C )( 0.10m−0 )=+10kV. Discussion for (a) The potential difference is positive, so the energy per unit positive charge is higher at the target than at the source. This means that free positive charges would fall from the target to the source. However, electrons are negative charges, so they accelerate from the source toward the target, gaining kinetic energy as they go. Strategy FOR (B) Apply conservation of energy to find the final kinetic energy of the electrons. In going from the source to the target, the change in electric potential energy plus the change in kinetic energy of the electrons must be zero, so Δ U E +ΔK=0 . The change in electric potential energy for moving through a constant electric field is given by the equation Δ U E =−qE( x f − x i ) , where the electric field is E=−100× 10 3 N/C . Because the electrons start at rest, their initial kinetic energy is zero. Thus, the change in kinetic energy is simply their final kinetic energy, so ΔK= K f . Solution for (b) Again x i =0 and x f =10cm=0.10m . The charge of an electron is q=−1.602× 10 −19 C . Conservation of energy gives Δ U E +ΔK = 0. −qE( x f − x i )+ K f = 0. K f = qE( x f − x i. ). Inserting the known values into the right-hand side of this equation gives K f = ( −1.60× 10 −19 C )( −100× 10 3 N/C )( 0.10m−0 ) = 1.6× 10 −15 J. Discussion for (b) This is a very small energy. However, electrons are very small, so they are easy to accelerate, and this energy is enough to make an electron go extremely fast. You can find their speed by using the definition of kinetic energy, K= 1 2 m v 2 . The result is that the electrons are moving at more than 100 million miles per hour! Electric Potential Energy of Doorknob and Dust Speck Consider again the doorknob from the example in the previous section. The doorknob is treated as a spherical conductor with a uniform static charge q 1 =−1.5nC on its surface. What is the electric potential energy between the doorknob and a speck of dust carrying a charge q 2 =0.20nC at 1.0 cm from the front surface of the doorknob? The diameter of the doorknob is 5.0 cm. Strategy As we did in the previous section, we treat the charge as if it were concentrated at the center of the doorknob. Again, as you will be able to validate in later physics classes, we can make this simplification, because the charge is uniformly distributed over the surface of the spherical object. Make a sketch of the situation and define a coordinate system, as shown in the image below. We use +x to indicate the outward direction perpendicular to the door, with x=0 at the center of the doorknob. If the diameter of the doorknob is 5.0 cm, its radius is 2.5 cm. Thus, the speck of dust 1.0 cm from the surface of the doorknob is a distance r=2.5cm+1.0cm=3.5cm from the center of the doorknob. To solve this problem, use the equation U E = k q 1 q 2 /r . Solution The charge on the doorknob is q 1 =−1.5nC=−1.5× 10 −9 C, and the charge on the speck of dust is q 2 =0.20nC=2.0× 10 −10 C . The distance r=3.5cm=0.035m . Inserting these values into the equation U E = k q 1 q 2 /r gives U E = k q 1 q 2 r = ( 8.99× 10 9 N⋅ m 2 /C 2 )( −1.5× 10 −9 C )( 2.0× 10 −10 C ) ( 0.035m ) = −7.7× 10 −8 J . Discussion The energy is negative, which means that the energy will decrease that is, get even more negative as the speck of dust approaches the doorknob. This helps explain why dust accumulates on objects that carry a static charge. However, note that insulators normally collect more static charge than conductors, because any charge that accumulates on insulators cannot move about on the insulator to find a way to escape. They must simply wait to be removed by some passing moist speck of dust or other host.

What is the analogous definition of electric potential energy? Electric potential energy is the potential for two charges to do work by virtue of their positions with respect to the origin point. Electric potential energy is the potential for two charges to do work by virtue of their positions with respect to infinity. Electric potential energy is the potential for two charges to do work by virtue of their positions with respect to each other. Electric potential energy is the potential for single charges to do work by virtue of their positions with respect to their final positions. A negative charge is 10 m from a positive charge. Where would you have to move the negative charge to increase the potential energy of the system? The negative charge should be moved closer to the positive charge. The negative charge should be moved farther away from the positive charge. The negative charge should be moved to infinity. The negative charge should be placed just next to the positive charge. Section Summary Electric potential energy is a concept similar to gravitational potential energy: It is the potential that charges have to do work by virtue of their positions relative to each other. Electric potential is the electric potential energy per unit charge. The potential is always measured between two points, where one point may be at infinity. Positive charges move from regions of high potential to regions of low potential. Negative charges move from regions of low potential to regions of high potential.

Section Key Terms capacitor dielectric Teacher Support To present capacitors, this section emphasizes their capacity to store energy. Dielectrics are introduced as a way to increase the amount of energy that can be stored in a capacitor. To introduce the idea of energy storage, discuss with students other mechanisms of storing energy, such as dams or batteries. Ask which have greater capacity. Capacitors Teacher Support Explain that electrical capacitors are vital parts of all electrical circuits. In fact, all electrical devices have a capacitance even if a capacitor is not explicitly put into the device. [BL]Have students define how the word capacity is used in everyday life. Have them look up the definition in the dictionary. Compare and contrast the everyday meaning with the meaning of the term in physics. [OL]Ask students whether they have heard the word capacitor used in conjunction with electricity, such as in power stations or electric circuits. Have them describe how the word is used. [AL]Discuss how a spring has a capacity to store mechanical energy. Discuss which properties of the spring would increase its capacity to store energy. Point out that these properties are intrinsic to the spring. Consider again the X-ray tube discussed in the previous sample problem. How can a uniform electric field be produced? A single positive charge produces an electric field that points away from it, as in . This field is not uniform, because the space between the lines increases as you move away from the charge. However, if we combine a positive and a negative charge, we obtain the electric field shown in (a). Notice that, between the charges, the electric field lines are more equally spaced.What happens if we place, say, five positive charges in a line across from five negative charges, as in ? Now the region between the lines of charge contains a fairly uniform electric field. The red dots are positive charges, and the blue dots are negative charges. The electric-field direction is shown by the red arrows. Notice that the electric field between the positive and negative dots is fairly uniform. We can extend this idea even further and into two dimensions by placing two metallic plates face to face and charging one with positive charge and the other with an equal magnitude of negative charge. This can be done by connecting one plate to the positive terminal of a battery and the other plate to the negative terminal, as shown in . The electric field between these charged plates will be extremely uniform. Two parallel metal plates are charged with opposite charge, by connecting the plates to the opposite terminals of a battery. The magnitude of the charge on each plate is the same. Let’s think about the work required to charge these plates. Before the plates are connected to the battery, they are neutral—that is, they have zero net charge. Placing the first positive charge on the left plate and the first negative charge on the right plate requires very little work, because the plates are neutral, so no opposing charges are present. Now consider placing a second positive charge on the left plate and a second negative charge on the right plate. Because the first two charges repel the new arrivals, a force must be applied to the two new charges over a distance to put them on the plates. This is the definition of work, which means that, compared with the first pair, more work is required to put the second pair of charges on the plates. To place the third positive and negative charges on the plates requires yet more work, and so on. Where does this work come from? The battery! Its chemical potential energy is converted into the work required to separate the positive and negative charges. Although the battery does work, this work remains within the battery-plate system. Therefore, conservation of energy tells us that, if the potential energy of the battery decreases to separate charges, the energy of another part of the system must increase by the same amount. In fact, the energy from the battery is stored in the electric field between the plates. This idea is analogous to considering that the potential energy of a raised hammer is stored in Earth’s gravitational field. If the gravitational field were to disappear, the hammer would have no potential energy. Likewise, if no electric field existed between the plates, no energy would be stored between them. If we now disconnect the plates from the battery, they will hold the energy. We could connect the plates to a lightbulb, for example, and the lightbulb would light up until this energy was used up. These plates thus have the capacity to store energy. For this reason, an arrangement such as this is called a capacitor. A capacitor is an arrangement of objects that, by virtue of their geometry, can store energy an electric field. Various real capacitors are shown in . They are usually made from conducting plates or sheets that are separated by an insulating material. They can be flat or rolled up or have other geometries. Some typical capacitors. (credit: Windell Oskay) The capacity of a capacitor is defined by its capacitance C, which is given by C= Q V , where Q is the magnitude of the charge on each capacitor plate, and V is the potential difference in going from the negative plate to the positive plate. This means that both Q and V are always positive, so the capacitance is always positive. We can see from the equation for capacitance that the units of capacitance are C/V, which are called farads (F) after the nineteenth-century English physicist Michael Faraday. The equation C=Q/V makes sense: A parallel-plate capacitor (like the one shown in ) the size of a football field could hold a lot of charge without requiring too much work per unit charge to push the charge into the capacitor. Thus, Q would be large, and V would be small, so the capacitance C would be very large. Squeezing the same charge into a capacitor the size of a fingernail would require much more work, so V would be very large, and the capacitance would be much smaller. Although the equation C=Q/V makes it seem that capacitance depends on voltage, in fact it does not. For a given capacitor, the ratio of the charge stored in the capacitor to the voltage difference between the plates of the capacitor always remains the same. Capacitance is determined by the geometry of the capacitor and the materials that it is made from. For a parallel-plate capacitor with nothing between its plates, the capacitance is given by C 0 = ε 0 A d , where A is the area of the plates of the capacitor and d is their separation. We use C 0 instead of C, because the capacitor has nothing between its plates (in the next section, we’ll see what happens when this is not the case). The constant ε 0 , read epsilon zero is called the permittivity of free space, and its value is ε 0 =8.85× 10 −12 F/m Coming back to the energy stored in a capacitor, we can ask exactly how much energy a capacitor stores. If a capacitor is charged by putting a voltage V across it for example, by connecting it to a battery with voltage V—the electrical potential energy stored in the capacitor is U E = 1 2 C V 2 . Notice that the form of this equation is similar to that for kinetic energy, K= 1 2 m v 2 . Where does Capacitance Come From? This video shows how capacitance is defined and why it depends only on the geometric properties of the capacitor, not on voltage or charge stored. In so doing, it provides a good review of the concepts of work and electric potential. If you increase the distance between the plates of a capacitor, how does the capacitance change? Doubling the distance between capacitor plates will reduce the capacitance four fold. Doubling the distance between capacitor plates will reduce the capacitance two fold. Doubling the distance between capacitor plates will increase the capacitance two times. Doubling the distance between capacitor plates will increase the capacitance four times. Charge your Capacitor In this simulation, you are presented with a parallel-plate capacitor connected to a variable-voltage battery. The battery is initially at zero volts, so no charge is on the capacitor. Slide the battery slider up and down to change the battery voltage, and observe the charges that accumulate on the plates. Display the capacitance, top-plate charge, and stored energy as you vary the battery voltage. You can also display the electric-field lines in the capacitor. Finally, probe the voltage between different points in this circuit with the help of the voltmeter. True or false— In a capacitor, the stored energy is always positive, regardless of whether the top plate is charged with negative or positive charge. false true Capacitance and Charge Stored in a Parallel Plate Capacitor (a) What is the capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor with metal plates, each of area 1.00 m2, separated by 0.0010 m? (b) What charge is stored in this capacitor if a voltage of 3.00 × 103 V is applied to it? Strategy FOR (A) Use the equation C 0 = ε 0 A d . Solution for (a) Entering the given values into this equation for the capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor yields C = ε 0 A d = ( 8.85× 10 −12 F/m ) 1.00 m 2 0.0010m = 8.9× 10 −9 F = 8.9nF . Discussion for (a) This small value for the capacitance indicates how difficult it is to make a device with a large capacitance. Special techniques help, such as using very-large-area thin foils placed close together or using a dielectric (to be discussed below). Strategy FOR (B) Knowing C, find the charge stored by solving the equation C=Q/V , for the charge Q. Solution for (b) The charge Q on the capacitor is Q = CV = ( 8.9× 10 −9 F )( 3.00× 10 3 V ) = 2.7× 10 −5 C . Discussion for (b) This charge is only slightly greater than typical static electricity charges. More charge could be stored by using a dielectric between the capacitor plates. What battery is needed to charge a capacitor? Your friend provides you with a 10μF capacitor. To store 120μC on this capacitor, what voltage battery should you buy? Strategy Use the equation C=Q/V to find the voltage needed to charge the capacitor. Solution Solving C=Q/V for the voltage gives V=Q/C . Inserting C=10μF=10× 10 −6 F and Q=120μC=120× 10 −6 C gives V= Q C = 120× 10 −6 C 10× 10 −6 F =12V Discussion Such a battery should be easy to procure. There is still a question of whether the battery contains enough energy to provide the desired charge. The equation U E = 1 2 C V 2 allows us to calculate the required energy. U E = 1 2 C V 2 = 1 2 ( 10× 10 −6 F ) ( 12V ) 2 =72mJ A typical commercial battery can easily provide this much energy. Practice Problems What is the voltage on a 35 μF with 25 nC of charge? 8.75 × 10−13 V 0.71 × 10−3 V 1.4 × 10−3 V 1.4 × 103 V Which voltage is across a 100 μF capacitor that stores 10 J of energy? −4.5 × 102 V 4.5 × 102 V ±4.5 × 102 V ±9 × 102 V Dielectrics Teacher Support Explain that dielectric is short for dielectric material, which has specific electrical properties to be discussed in this section. The word dielectric is used to indicate the energy-storage capacity of a material. Remind students that insulator is used to indicate the ability of a material to prevent the passage of electric charge. [BL][OL]Point out that the prefix di means two or double. Combined with the word electric, this implies that a dielectric can have two electric charges. [AL]Ask students whether they know of other words that use the prefix di in science (diatomic, carbon dioxide, dipole, …). Before working through some sample problems, let’s look at what happens if we put an insulating material between the plates of a capacitor that has been charged and then disconnected from the charging battery, as illustrated in . Because the material is insulating, the charge cannot move through it from one plate to the other, so the charge Q on the capacitor does not change. An electric field exists between the plates of a charged capacitor, so the insulating material becomes polarized, as shown in the lower part of the figure. An electrically insulating material that becomes polarized in an electric field is called a dielectric. shows that the negative charge in the molecules in the material shifts to the left, toward the positive charge of the capacitor. This shift is due to the electric field, which applies a force to the left on the electrons in the molecules of the dielectric. The right sides of the molecules are now missing a bit of negative charge, so their net charge is positive. The top and bottom capacitors carry the same charge Q. The top capacitor has no dielectric between its plates. The bottom capacitor has a dielectric between its plates. The molecules in the dielectric are polarized by the electric field of the capacitor. Teacher Support Point out the positive and negative surface charge on each side of the dielectric. Discuss with students that the electric-field lines are drawn so that they touch the surface charges, because electric-field lines always start or terminate on a charge. Thus, fewer electric-field lines will traverse the dielectric, meaning the electric field is weaker inside the dielectric. All electrically insulating materials are dielectrics, but some are better dielectrics than others. A good dielectric is one whose molecules allow their electrons to shift strongly in an electric field. In other words, an electric field pulls their electrons a fair bit away from their atom, but they do not escape completely from their atom (which is why they are insulators). shows a macroscopic view of a dielectric in a charged capacitor. Notice that the electric-field lines in the capacitor with the dielectric are spaced farther apart than the electric-field lines in the capacitor with no dielectric. This means that the electric field in the dielectric is weaker, so it stores less electrical potential energy than the electric field in the capacitor with no dielectric. Where has this energy gone? In fact, the molecules in the dielectric act like tiny springs, and the energy in the electric field goes into stretching these springs. With the electric field thus weakened, the voltage difference between the two sides of the capacitor is smaller, so it becomes easier to put more charge on the capacitor. Placing a dielectric in a capacitor before charging it therefore allows more charge and potential energy to be stored in the capacitor. A parallel plate with a dielectric has a capacitance of C=κ ε 0 A d =κ C 0 , where κ (kappa) is a dimensionless constant called the dielectric constant. Because κ is greater than 1 for dielectrics, the capacitance increases when a dielectric is placed between the capacitor plates. The dielectric constant of several materials is shown in . Dielectric Constants for Various Materials at 20 °C Material Dielectric Constant ( κ ) Vacuum 1.00000 Air 1.00059 Fused quartz 3.78 Neoprene rubber 6.7 Nylon 3.4 Paper 3.7 Polystyrene 2.56 Pyrex glass 5.6 Silicon oil 2.5 Strontium titanate 233 Teflon 2.1 Water 80 The top and bottom capacitors carry the same charge Q. The top capacitor has no dielectric between its plates. The bottom capacitor has a dielectric between its plates. Because some electric-field lines terminate and start on polarization charges in the dielectric, the electric field is less strong in the capacitor. Thus, for the same charge, a capacitor stores less energy when it contains a dielectric. Teacher Support Emphasize that the electric-field lines in the dielectric are less dense than in the capacitor with no dielectric, which shows that the electric field is weaker in the dielectric. Capacitor for Camera Flash A typical flash for a point-and-shoot camera uses a capacitor of about 200μF . (a) If the potential difference between the capacitor plates is 100 V—that is, 100 V is placed “across the capacitor,” how much energy is stored in the capacitor? (b) If the dielectric used in the capacitor were a 0.010-mm-thick sheet of nylon, what would be the surface area of the capacitor plates? Strategy FOR (A) Given that V=100V and C=200× 10 −6 F , we can use the equation U E = 1 2 C V 2 , to find the electric potential energy stored in the capacitor. Solution for (a) Inserting the given quantities into U E = 1 2 C V 2 gives U E = 1 2 C V 2 = 1 2 ( 200× 10 −6 F ) ( 100V ) 2 = 1.0J . Discussion for (a) This is enough energy to lift a 1-kg ball about 1 m up from the ground. The flash lasts for about 0.001 s, so the power delivered by the capacitor during this brief time is P= U E t = 1.0J 0.001s =1kW . Considering that a car engine delivers about 100 kW of power, this is not bad for a little capacitor! Strategy FOR (B) Because the capacitor plates are in contact with the dielectric, we know that the spacing between the capacitor plates is d=0.010mm=1.0× 10 −5 m . From the previous table, the dielectric constant of nylon is κ=3.4 . We can now use the equation C=κ ε 0 A d to find the area A of the capacitor. Solution (b) Solving the equation for the area A and inserting the known quantities gives C = κ ε 0 A d A = Cd κ ε 0 = ( 200× 10 −6 F )( 1.0× 10 −5 m ) ( 3.4 )( 8.85× 10 −12 F/m ) = 66 m 2 . Discussion for (b) This is much too large an area to roll into a capacitor small enough to fit in a handheld camera. This is why these capacitors don’t use simple dielectrics but a more advanced technology to obtain a high capacitance. Practice Problems With 12 V across a capacitor, it accepts 10 mC of charge.

It does not depend on the voltage across the capacitor. Capacitors store electrical energy in the electric field between their plates. A dielectric material is an insulator that is polarized in an electric field. Putting a dielectric between the plates of a capacitor increases the capacitance of the capacitor. Key Equations capacitance C= Q V energy stored in a capacitor U E = 1 2 C V 2 capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor C=κ ε 0 A d Concept Items You insert a dielectric into an air-filled capacitor. How does this affect the energy stored in the capacitor? Energy stored in the capacitor will remain same. Energy stored in the capacitor will decrease. Energy stored in the capacitor will increase. Energy stored in the capacitor will increase first, and then it will decrease. True or false Placing a dielectric between the plates of a capacitor increases the energy of the capacitor. false true True or false The electric field in an air-filled capacitor is reduced when a dielectric is inserted between the plates. false true Critical Thinking When you insert a dielectric into a capacitor that has been charged and then disconnected from the charging battery, the energy stored in the capacitor decreases. If you take the dielectric out, the energy increases again. Where does this energy go in the former case, and where does the energy come from in the latter case? Energy is released by the dielectric when it is introduced between the plates and then reabsorbed when it is removed. The energy goes into polarizing the dielectric when it is added. When you remove the dielectric, energy comes from your work pulling on the dielectric. Energy goes into you when you insert the dielectric, and comes from you when you remove it. Energy is released to polarize the dielectric when it is introduced between the plates. The polarized dielectric transfers the energy back into the capacitor when the dielectric is removed.

(c) Given that the electric force is much stronger than the gravitational force, discuss why the law for gravitational force was discovered much earlier than the law for electric force. (d) Consider a hydrogen atom, which is a single proton orbited by a single electron. The electric force holds the electron and proton together so that the hydrogen atom has a radius of about 0.5× 10 −10 m . Assuming the force between electron and proton does not change, what would be the approximate radius of the hydrogen atom if k=6.67× 10 −11 N⋅ m 2 /C 2 ? Teacher Support HS-PS2-4. Use mathematical representations of Newton’s law of gravitation and Coulomb’s law to describe and predict the gravitational and electrostatic forces between objects. Clarification statementEmphasis is on quantitative and conceptual descriptions of gravitational and electric fields. Assessment boundaryAssessment is limited to systems with two objects. (a) For both laws, the force varies as the inverse of the distance between the objects. The forces increase fourfold if the distance is reduced by half and decrease fourfold if the distance is doubled. (b) Both laws vary as the inverse distance squared between the objects. Because charge can be positive or negative, the electric force can be attractive or repulsive, whereas the force of gravity is only attractive because mass is a strictly positive quantity. Finally, the constants involved show that the electric force is typically much stronger than the force of gravity. (c) Because gravity is only attractive, it is noticeable on a macroscopic scale. The electric force between most macroscopic objects is very small, because such objects typically contain equal amounts of positive and negative charge. Thus, the electric force between macroscopic objects is typically not noticeable.

Section Key Terms alternating current ampere conventional current direct current electric current nonohmic ohmic Ohm’s law resistance Direct and Alternating CurrentJust as water flows from high to low elevation, electrons that are free to move will travel from a place with low potential to a place with high potential. A battery has two terminals that are at different potentials. If the terminals are connected by a conducting wire, an electric current (charges) will flow, as shown in . Electrons will then move from the low-potential terminal of the battery (the negative end) through the wire and enter the high-potential terminal of the battery (the positive end). A battery has a wire connecting the positive and negative terminals, which allows electrons to move from the negative terminal to the positive terminal. Teacher Support Stress that electrons move from the negative terminal to the positive terminal because they carry negative charge, so they are repelled by the Coulomb force from the negative terminal. Electric current is the rate at which electric charge moves. A large current, such as that used to start a truck engine, moves a large amount very quickly, whereas a small current, such as that used to operate a hand-held calculator, moves a small amount of charge more slowly. In equation form, electric current I is defined as I= ΔQ Δt where ΔQ is the amount of charge that flows past a given area and Δt is the time it takes for the charge to move past the area. The SI unit for electric current is the ampere (A), which is named in honor of the French physicist André-Marie Ampère (1775–1836). One ampere is one coulomb per second, or 1A=1C/s. Electric current moving through a wire is in many ways similar to water current moving through a pipe. To define the flow of water through a pipe, we can count the water molecules that flow past a given section of the pipe. As shown in , electric current is very similar. We count the number of electrical charges that flow past a section of a conductor; in this case, a wire. The electric current moving through this wire is the charge that moves past the cross-section A divided by the time it takes for this charge to move past the section A. Teacher Support Point out that the charge carriers in this sketch are positive, so they move in the same direction as the electric current. Assume each particle q in carries a charge q=1nC , in which case the total charge shown would be ΔQ=5q=5nC . If these charges move past the area A in a time Δt=1ns , then the current would be I= ΔQ Δt = 5nC 1ns =5A. Note that we assigned a positive charge to the charges in . Normally, negative charges—electrons—are the mobile charge in wires, as indicated in . Positive charges are normally stuck in place in solids and cannot move freely. However, because a positive current moving to the right is the same as a negative current of equal magnitude moving to the left, as shown in , we define conventional current to flow in the direction that a positive charge would flow if it could move. Thus, unless otherwise specified, an electric current is assumed to be composed of positive charges. Also note that one Coulomb is a significant amount of electric charge, so 5 A is a very large current. Most often you will see current on the order of milliamperes (mA). (a) The electric field points to the right, the current moves to the right, and positive charges move to the right. (b) The equivalent situation but with negative charges moving to the left. The electric field and the current are still to the right. Teacher Support Point out that the electric field is the same in both cases, and that the current is in the direction of the electric field. Make sure that students understand that current is defined as the direction in which positive charge would flow, even if electrons are most often the mobile charge carriers. Mathematically, the result is the same whether we assume positive charge flowing one way or negative charge flowing the opposite way. Physically, however, the situation is quite different (although the difference is reduced once holes are defined). Vegetable Current This lab helps students understand how current works. Given that particles confined in a pipe cannot occupy the same space, pushing more particles into one end of the pipe will force the same number of particles out of the opposite end. This creates a current of particles. Find a straw and dried peas that can move freely in the straw. Place the straw flat on a table and fill the straw with peas. When you push one pea in at one end, a different pea should come out of the other end. This demonstration is a model for an electric current. Identify the part of the model that represents electrons and the part of the model that represents the supply of electrical energy. For a period of 30 s, count the number of peas you can push through the straw. When finished, calculate the pea current by dividing the number of peas by the time in seconds. Note that the flow of peas is based on the peas physically bumping into each other; electrons push each other along due to mutually repulsive electrostatic forces. The direction of conventional current is the direction that positive charge would flow. Depending on the situation, positive charges, negative charges, or both may move. In metal wires, as we have seen, current is carried by electrons, so the negative charges move. In ionic solutions, such as salt water, both positively charged and negatively charged ions move. This is also true in nerve cells. Pure positive currents are relatively rare but do occur. History credits American politician and scientist Benjamin Franklin with describing current as the direction that positive charges flow through a wire. He named the type of charge associated with electrons negative long before they were known to carry current in so many situations. As electrons move through a metal wire, they encounter obstacles such as other electrons, atoms, impurities, etc. The electrons scatter from these obstacles, as depicted in . Normally, the electrons lose energy with each interaction. This energy is transferred to the wire and becomes thermal energy, which is what makes wires hot when they carry a lot of current. To keep the electrons moving thus requires a force, which is supplied by an electric field. The electric field in a wire points from the end of the wire at the higher potential to the end of the wire at the lower potential. Electrons, carrying a negative charge, move on average (or drift) in the direction opposite the electric field, as shown in . Free electrons moving in a conductor make many collisions with other electrons and atoms. The path of one electron is shown. The average velocity of free electrons is in the direction opposite to the electric field. The collisions normally transfer energy to the conductor, so a constant supply of energy is required to maintain a steady current. So far, we have discussed current that moves constantly in a single direction. This is called direct current, because the electric charge flows in only one direction. Direct current is often called DC current. Many sources of electrical power, such as the hydroelectric dam shown at the beginning of this chapter, produce alternating current, in which the current direction alternates back and forth. Alternating current is often called AC current. Alternating current moves back and forth at regular time intervals, as shown in . The alternating current that comes from a normal wall socket does not suddenly switch directions. Rather, it increases smoothly up to a maximum current and then smoothly decreases back to zero. It then grows again, but in the opposite direction until it has reached the same maximum value. After that, it decreases smoothly back to zero, and the cycle starts over again. With alternating current, the direction of the current reverses at regular time intervals. The graph on the top shows the current versus time. The negative maxima correspond to the current moving to the left. The positive maxima correspond to current moving to the right. The current alternates regularly and smoothly between these two maxima. Teacher Support Help students interpret the graph, emphasizing that the current does not change direction instantaneously but instead smoothly transitions from one maximum to the opposite maximum and back. Explain that the four images at the bottom show the current at the respective maxima. Note that, to simplify the interpretation, the mobile carriers in the image are taken to be positive. Devices that use AC include vacuum cleaners, fans, power tools, hair dryers, and countless others. These devices obtain the power they require when you plug them into a wall socket. The wall socket is connected to the power grid that provides an alternating potential (AC potential). When your device is plugged in, the AC potential pushes charges back and forth in the circuit of the device, creating an alternating current. Many devices, however, use DC, such as computers, cell phones, flashlights, and cars. One source of DC is a battery, which provides a constant potential (DC potential) between its terminals. With your device connected to a battery, the DC potential pushes charge in one direction through the circuit of your device, creating a DC current. Another way to produce DC current is by using a transformer, which converts AC potential to DC potential. Small transformers that you can plug into a wall socket are used to charge up your laptop, cell phone, or other electronic device. People generally call this a charger or a battery, but it is a transformer that transforms AC voltage into DC voltage. The next time someone asks to borrow your laptop charger, tell them that you don’t have a laptop charger, but that they may borrow your converter. Current in a Lightning Strike A lightning strike can transfer as many as 10 20 electrons from the cloud to the ground. If the strike lasts 2 ms, what is the average electric current in the lightning? Strategy Use the definition of current, I= ΔQ Δt . The charge ΔQ from 10 20 electrons is ΔQ=ne , where n= 10 20 is the number of electrons and e=−1.60× 10 −19 C is the charge on the electron. This gives ΔQ= 10 20 ×( −1.60× 10 −19 C )=−16.0C. The time Δt=2× 10 −3 s is the duration of the lightning strike. Solution The current in the lightning strike is I = ΔQ Δt = −16.0C 2× 10 −3 s = −8kA. Discussion The negative sign reflects the fact that electrons carry the negative charge. Thus, although the electrons flow from the cloud to the ground, the positive current is defined to flow from the ground to the cloud. Average Current to Charge a Capacitor In a circuit containing a capacitor and a resistor, it takes 1 min to charge a 16 μF capacitor by using a 9-V battery. What is the average current during this time? Strategy We can determine the charge on the capacitor by using the definition of capacitance: C= Q V . When the capacitor is charged by a 9-V battery, the voltage across the capacitor will be V=9V . This gives a charge of C = Q V Q = CV. By inserting this expression for charge into the equation for current, I= ΔQ Δt , we can find the average current. Solution The average current is I = ΔQ Δt = CV Δt = ( 16× 10 −6 F )( 9V ) 60s = 2.4× 10 −6 A = 2.4μA. Discussion This small current is typical of the current encountered in circuits such as this. Practice Problems 10 nC of charge flows through a circuit in 3.0 × 10−6 s . What is the current during this time? The current passes through the circuit is 3.3 × 10−3 A. The current passes through the circuit is 30 A. The current passes through the circuit is 33 A. The current passes through the circuit is 0.3 A. Resistance and Ohm’s LawAs mentioned previously, electrical current in a wire is in many ways similar to water flowing through a pipe. The water current that can flow through a pipe is affected by obstacles in the pipe, such as clogs and narrow sections in the pipe. These obstacles slow down the flow of current through the pipe. Similarly, electrical current in a wire can be slowed down by many factors, including impurities in the metal of the wire or collisions between the charges in the material. These factors create a resistance to the electrical current. Resistance is a description of how much a wire or other electrical component opposes the flow of charge through it. In the 19th century, the German physicist Georg Simon Ohm (1787–1854) found experimentally that current through a conductor is proportional to the voltage drop across a current-carrying conductor. I∝V The constant of proportionality is the resistance R of the material, which leads to V=IR(1.3). This relationship is called Ohm’s law. It can be viewed as a cause-and-effect relationship, with voltage being the cause and the current being the effect. Ohm’s law is an empirical law like that for friction, which means that it is an experimentally observed phenomenon. The units of resistance are volts per ampere, or V/A. We call a V/A an ohm, which is represented by the uppercase Greek letter omega ( Ω ). Thus, 1Ω=1V/A(1.4). Ohm’s law holds for most materials and at common temperatures. At very low temperatures, resistance may drop to zero (superconductivity). At very high temperatures, the thermal motion of atoms in the material inhibits the flow of electrons, increasing the resistance. The many substances for which Ohm’s law holds are called ohmic. Ohmic materials include good conductors like copper, aluminum, and silver, and some poor conductors under certain circumstances. The resistance of ohmic materials remains essentially the same for a wide range of voltage and current. Introduction to Electricity, Circuits, Current, and Resistance This video presents Ohm’s law and shows a simple electrical circuit. The speaker uses the analogy of pressure to describe how electric potential makes charge move. He refers to electric potential as electric pressure. Another way of thinking about electric potential is to imagine that lots of particles of the same sign are crowded in a small, confined space. Because these charges have the same sign (they are all positive or all negative), each charge repels the others around it. This means that lots of charges are constantly being pushed towards the outside of the space. A complete electric circuit is like opening a door in the small space: Whichever particles are pushed towards the door now have a way to escape. The higher the electric potential, the harder each particle pushes against the others. Ohm’s Law This simulation mimics a simple circuit with batteries providing the voltage source and a resistor connected across the batteries. See how the current is affected by modifying the resistance and/or the voltage. Note that the resistance is modeled as an element containing small scattering centers. These represent impurities or other obstacles that impede the passage of the current. Resistance of a Headlight What is the resistance of an automobile headlight through which 2.50 A flows when 12.0 V is applied to it? Strategy Ohm’s law tells us V headlight =I R headlight . The voltage drop in going through the headlight is just the voltage rise supplied by the battery, V headlight = V battery . We can use this equation and rearrange Ohm’s law to find the resistance R headlight of the headlight. Solution Solving Ohm’s law for the resistance of the headlight gives V headlight = I R headlight V battery = I R headlight R headlight = V battery I = 12V 2.5A =4.8Ω. Discussion This is a relatively small resistance. As we will see below, resistances in circuits are commonly measured in kΩ or MΩ. Determine Resistance from Current-Voltage Graph Suppose you apply several different voltages across a circuit and measure the current that runs through the circuit. A plot of your results is shown in . What is the resistance of the circuit? The line shows the current as a function of voltage. Notice that the current is given in milliamperes. For example, at 3 V, the current is 0.003 A, or 3 mA. Strategy The plot shows that current is proportional to voltage, which is Ohm’s law. In Ohm’s law ( V=IR ), the constant of proportionality is the resistance R. Because the graph shows current as a function of voltage, we have to rearrange Ohm’s law in that form: I= V R = 1 R ×V . This shows that the slope of the line of I versus V is 1 R . Thus, if we find the slope of the line in , we can calculate the resistance R. Solution The slope of the line is the rise divided by the run. Looking at the lower-left square of the grid, we see that the line rises by 1 mA (0.001 A) and runs over a voltage of 1 V. Thus, the slope of the line is slope= 0.001A 1V. Equating the slope with 1 R and solving for R gives 1 R = 0.001A 1 R = 1V 0.001A =1,000Ω or 1 k-ohm. Discussion This resistance is greater than what we found in the previous example. Resistances such as this are common in electric circuits, as we will discover in the next section. Note that if the line in were not straight, then the material would not be ohmic and we would not be able to use Ohm’s law. Materials that do not follow Ohm’s law are called nonohmic. Practice Problems Check Your Understanding Section Summary Direct current is constant over time; alternating current alternates smoothly back and forth over time. Electrical resistance causes materials to extract work from the current that flows through them. In ohmic materials, voltage drop along a path is proportional to the current that runs through the path.

What is the current if the linear density of He nuclei is λ = 108 m–1? I = 9.6 × 10–5 A I = 3.2 × 10–5 A I = 12.8 × 10–5 A I = 6.4 × 10–5 A Problems What voltage is needed to make 6 C of charge traverse a 100-Ω resistor in 1 min? The required voltage is 1 × 10−3 V. The required voltage is 10 V. The required voltage is 1,000 V. The required voltage is 10,000 V. Resistors typically obey Ohm’s law at low currents, but show deviations at higher currents because of heating. Suppose you were to conduct an experiment measuring the voltage, V, across a resistor as a function of current, I, including currents whose deviations from Ohms law start to become apparent. For a data plot of V versus I, which of the following functions would be best to fit the data? Assume that a, b, and c are nonzero constants adjusted to fit the data. V=aI V=aI+b V=aI+b I 2 V=aI+b I 2 +c The correct answer is (c). Choice (a) can be eliminated because it does not show deviations from Ohm’s Law. Choices (b) and (d) can be eliminated because the voltage drop across the resistor would be nonzero when the current is zero, which is inconsistent with the fact that Ohm’s Law is obeyed at low currents. Choice (c) follows Ohm’s Law at low currents because the linear term will dominate the quadratic term, with deviations from Ohm’s Law becoming apparent at higher currents.

Section Key Terms circuit diagram electric circuit equivalent resistance in series resistor steady state Electric Circuits and ResistorsNow that we understand the concept of electric current, let’s see what we can do with it. As you are no doubt aware, the modern lifestyle relies heavily on electrical devices. These devices contain ingenious electric circuits, which are complete, closed pathways through which electric current flows. Returning to our water analogy, an electric circuit is to electric charge like a network of pipes is to water: The electric circuit guides electric charge from one point to the next, running the charge through various devices along the way to extract work or information. Electric circuits are made from many materials and cover a huge range of sizes, as shown in . Computers and cell phones contain electric circuits whose features can be as small as roughly a billionth of a meter (a nanometer, or 10 −9 m ). The pathways that guide the current in these devices are made by ultraprecise chemical treatments of silicon or other semiconductors. Large power systems, on the other hand, contain electric circuits whose features are on the scale of meters. These systems carry such large electric currents that their physical dimensions must be relatively large. The photo on the left shows a chip that contains complex integrated electric circuitry. Chips such as this are at the heart of devices such as computers and cell phones. The photograph on the right shows some typical electric circuitry required for high-power electric power transmission. The pathways that form electric circuits are made from a conducting material, normally a metal in macroscopic circuits. For example, copper wires inside your school building form the electrical circuits that power lighting, projectors, screens, speakers, etc. To represent an electric circuit, we draw circuit diagrams. We use lines and symbols to represent the elements in the circuit. A simple electric circuit diagram is shown on the left side of . On the right side is an analogous water circuit, which we discuss below. On the left is a circuit diagram showing a battery (in red), a resistor (black zigzag element), and the current I. On the right is the analogous water circuit. The pump is like the battery, the sand filter is like the resistor, the water current is like the electrical current, and the reservoir is like the ground. Teacher Support Review the analogy between water flow and electric current to ensure that students understand it. To explain the analogy between pressure and voltage, compare water molecules compressed together under high pressure with electric charges compressed together under high voltage. Explain that the water pump increases the water pressure and that the battery increases the voltage. Other comparisons to discuss include the resistor versus the sand filter, and the ground versus the reservoir. There are many different symbols that scientists and engineers use in circuit diagrams, but we will focus on four main symbols: the wire, the battery or voltage source, resistors, and the ground. The thin black lines in the electric circuit diagram represent the pathway that the electric charge must follow. These pathways are assumed to be perfect conductors, so electric charge can move along these pathways without losing any energy. In reality, the wires in circuits are not perfect, but they come close enough for our purposes. The zigzag element labeled R is a resistor, which is a circuit element that provides a known resistance. Macroscopic resistors are often color coded to indicate their resistance, as shown in . The red element in is a battery, with its positive and negative terminals indicated; the longer line represents the positive terminal of the battery, and the shorter line represents the negative terminal. Note that the battery icon is not always colored red; this is done in just to make it easy to identify. Finally, the element labeled ground on the lower left of the circuit indicates that the circuit is connected to Earth, which is a large, essentially neutral object containing an infinite amount of charge. Among other things, the ground determines the potential of the negative terminal of the battery. Normally, the potential of the ground is defined to be zero: V ground ≡0 . This means that the entire lower wire in is at a voltage of zero volts. Some typical resistors. The color bands indicate the value of the resistance of each resistor. The electric current in is indicted by the blue line labeled I. The arrow indicates the direction in which positive charge would flow in this circuit. Recall that, in metals, electrons are mobile charge carriers, so negative charges actually flow in the opposite direction around this circuit (i.e., counterclockwise). However, we draw the current to show the direction in which positive charge would move. On the right side of is an analogous water circuit. Water at a higher pressure leaves the top of the pump, which is like charges leaving the positive terminal of the battery. The water travels through the pipe, like the charges traveling through the wire. Next, the water goes through a sand filter, which heats up as the water squeezes through. This step is like the charges going through the resistor. When charges flow through a resistor, they do work to heat up the resistor. After flowing through the sand filter, the water has converted its potential energy into heat, so it is at a lower pressure. Likewise, the charges exiting the resistor have converted their potential energy into heat, so they are at a lower voltage. Recall that voltage is just potential energy per charge. Thus, water pressure is analogous to electric potential energy (i.e., voltage). Coming back to the water circuit again, we see that the water returns to the bottom of the pump, which is like the charge returning to the negative terminal of the battery. The water pump uses a source of energy to pump the water back up to a high pressure again, giving it the pressure required to go through the circuit once more. The water pump is like the battery, which uses chemical energy to increase the voltage of the charge up to the level of the positive terminal. The potential energy per charge at the positive terminal of the battery is the voltage rating of the battery. This voltage is like water pressure in the upper pipe. Just like a higher pressure forces water to move toward a lower pressure, a higher voltage forces electric charge to flow toward a lower voltage. The pump takes water at low pressure and does work on it, ejecting water at a higher pressure. Likewise, a battery takes charge at a low voltage, does work on it, and ejects charge at a higher voltage. Note that the current in the water circuit of is the same throughout the circuit. In other words, if we measured the number of water molecules passing a cross-section of the pipe per unit time at any point in the circuit, we would get the same answer no matter where in the circuit we measured. The same is true of the electrical circuit in the same figure. The electric current is the same at all points in this circuit, including inside the battery and in the resistor. The electric current neither speeds up in the wires nor slows down in the resistor. This would create points where too much or too little charge would be bunched up. Thus, the current is the same at all points in the circuit shown in . Although the current is the same everywhere in both the electric and water circuits, the voltage or water pressure changes as you move through the circuits. In the water circuit, the water pressure at the pump outlet stays the same until the water goes through the sand filter, assuming no energy loss in the pipe. Likewise, the voltage in the electrical circuit is the same at all points in a given wire, because we have assumed that the wires are perfect conductors. Thus, as indicated by the constant red color of the upper wire in , the voltage throughout this wire is constant at V= V battery . The voltage then drops as you go through the resistor, but once you reach the blue wire, the voltage stays at its new level of V=0 all the way to the negative terminal of the battery (i.e., the blue terminal of the battery). The voltage in the red wire is constant at V= V battery from the positive terminal of the battery to the top of the resistor. The voltage in the blue wire is constant at V= V ground =0 from the bottom of the resistor to the negative terminal of the battery. Teacher Support Explain that, as you descend through the resistor, the voltage decreases linearly from the battery voltage to zero. If we go from the blue wire through the battery to the red wire, the voltage increases from V=0 to V= V battery . Likewise, if we go from the blue wire up through the resistor to the red wire, the voltage also goes from V=0 to V= V battery . Thus, using Ohm’s law, we can write V resistor = V battery =IR. Note that V resistor is measured from the bottom of the resistor to the top, meaning that the top of the resistor is at a higher voltage than the bottom of the resistor. Thus, current flows from the top of the resistor or higher voltage to the bottom of the resistor or lower voltage. Battery-Resistor Circuit Use this simulation to better understand how resistance, voltage, and current are related. The simulation shows a battery with a resistor connected between the terminals of the battery, as in the previous figure. You can modify the battery voltage and the resistance. The simulation shows how electrons react to these changes. It also shows the atomic cores in the resistor and how they are excited and heat up as more current goes through the resistor. Draw the circuit diagram for the circuit, being sure to draw an arrow indicating the direction of the current. Now pick three spots along the wire. Without changing the settings, allow the simulation to run for 20 s while you count the number of electrons passing through that spot. Record the number on the circuit diagram. Now do the same thing at each of the other two spots in the circuit. What do you notice about the number of charges passing through each spot in 20 s? Remember that that current is defined as the rate that charges flow through the circuit. What does this mean about the current through the entire circuit? Other possible circuit elements include capacitors and switches. These are drawn as shown on the left side of . A switch is a device that opens and closes the circuit, like a light switch. It is analogous to a valve in a water circuit, as shown on the right side of . With the switch open, no current passes through the circuit. With the switch closed, it becomes part of the wire, so the current passes through it with no loss of voltage. The capacitor is labeled C on the left of . A capacitor in an electrical circuit is analogous to a flexible membrane in a water circuit. When the switch is closed in the circuit of , the battery forces electrical current to flow toward the capacitor, charging the upper capacitor plate with positive charge. As this happens, the voltage across the capacitor plates increases. This is like the membrane in the water circuit: When the valve is opened, the pump forces water to flow toward the membrane, making it stretch to store the excess water. As this happens, the pressure behind the membrane increases. Now if we open the switch, the capacitor holds the voltage between its plates because the charges have nowhere to go. Likewise, if we close the valve, the water has nowhere to go and the membrane maintains the water pressure in the pipe between itself and the valve. If the switch is closed for a long time in the electric circuit or if the valve is open for a long time in the water circuit, the current will eventually stop flowing because the capacitor or the membrane will have become completely charged. Each circuit is now in the steady state, which means that its characteristics do not change over time. In this case, the steady state is characterized by zero current, and this does not change as long as the switch or valve remains in the same position. In the steady state, no electrical current passes through the capacitor, and no water current passes through the membrane. The voltage difference between the capacitor plates will be the same as the battery voltage. In the water circuit, the pressure behind the membrane will be the same as the pressure created by the pump. Although the circuit in may seem a bit pointless because all that happens when the switch is closed is that the capacitor charges up, it does show the capacitor’s ability to store charge. Thus, the capacitor serves as a reservoir for charge. This property of capacitors is used in circuits in many ways. For example, capacitors are used to power circuits while batteries are being charged. In addition, capacitors can serve as filters. To understand this, let’s go back to the water analogy. Suppose you have a water hose and are watering your garden. Your friend thinks he’s funny, and kinks the hose. While the hose is kinked, you experience no water flow. When he lets go, the water starts flowing again. If he does this really fast, you experience water-no water-water-no water, and that’s really no way to water your garden. Now imagine that the hose is filling up a big bucket, and you are watering from the bottom of the bucket. As long as you had water in your bucket to begin with and your friend doesn’t kink the water hose for too long, you would be able to water your garden without the interruptions. Your friend kinking the water hose is filtered by the big bucket’s supply of water, so it does not impact your ability to water the garden. We can think of the interruptions in the current (be it water or electrical current) as noise. Capacitors act in an analogous way as the water bucket to help filter out the noise. Capacitors have so many uses that it is very rare to find an electronic circuit that does not include some capacitors. On the left is an electrical circuit containing a battery, a switch, and a capacitor. On the left is the analogous water circuit with a pump, a valve, and a stretchable membrane. The pump is like the battery, the valve is like the switch, and the stretchable membrane is like the capacitor. When the switch is closed, electrical current flows as the capacitor charges and its voltage increases. Likewise in the water circuit, when the valve is open, water current flows as the stretchable membrane stretches and the water pressure behind it increases. Teacher Support Point out that, when the switch is open, no current flows, which differs from the water valve that allows current to flow when it is open. Explain that the pressure difference in the water capacitor is supported by the membrane, which supplies a pressure to hold back the high-pressure water. Likewise, the capacitor provides a voltage to hold back the high-voltage charges. What It Takes to be an Electrical Engineer Physics is used in a wide variety of fields. One field that requires a very thorough knowledge of physics is electrical engineering. An electrical engineer can work on anything from the large-scale power systems that provide power to big cities to the nanoscale electronic circuits that are found in computers and cell phones (). In working with power companies, you can be responsible for maintaining the power grid that supplies electrical power to large areas. Although much of this work is done from an office, it is common to be called in for overtime duty after storms or other natural events. Many electrical engineers enjoy this part of the job, which requires them to race around the countryside repairing high-voltage transformers and other equipment. However, one of the more unpleasant aspects of this work is to remove the carcasses of unfortunate squirrels or other animals that have wandered into the transformers. Other careers in electrical engineering can involve designing circuits for cell phones, which requires cramming some 10 billion transistors into an electronic chip the size of your thumbnail. These jobs can involve much work with computer simulations and can also involve fields other than electronics. For example, the 1-m-diameter lenses that are used to make these circuits (as of 2015) are so precise that they are shipped from the manufacture to the chip fabrication plant in temperature-controlled trucks to ensure that they are held within a certain temperature range. If they heat up or cool down too much, they deform ever so slightly, rendering them useless for the ultrahigh precision photolithography required to manufacture these chips. In addition to a solid knowledge of physics, electrical engineers must above all be practical. Consider, for example, how one corporation managed to launch some anti-ballistic missiles at the White Sands Missile Test Range in New Mexico in the 1960s. Before launch, the skin of the missile had to be at the same voltage as the rail from which it was launched. The rail was connected to the ground by a large copper wire connected to a stake driven into the sandy earth. The missile, however, was connected by an umbilical cord to the equipment in the control shed a few meters away, which was grounded via a different grounding circuit. Before launching the missile, the voltage difference between the missile skin and the rail had to be less than 2.5 V. After an especially dry spell of weather, the missile could not be launched because the voltage difference stood at 5 V. A group of electrical engineers, including the father of your author, stood around pondering how to reduce the voltage difference. The situation was resolved when one of the engineers realized that urine contains electrolytes and conducts electricity quite well. With that, the four engineers quickly resolved the problem by urinating on the rail spike. The voltage difference immediately dropped to below 2.5 V and the missile was launched on schedule. The systems that electrical engineers work on range from microprocessor circuits (left)] to missile systems (right). Amuse yourself by building circuits of all different shapes and sizes. This simulation provides you with various standard circuit elements, such as batteries, AC voltage sources, resistors, capacitors, light bulbs, switches, etc. You can connect these in any configuration you like and then see the result. Build a circuit that starts with a resistor connected to a capacitor. Connect the free side of the resistor to the positive terminal of a battery and the free side of the capacitor to the negative terminal of the battery. Click the reset dynamics button to see how the current flows starting with no charge on the capacitor. Now right click on the resistor to change its value. When you increase the resistance, does the circuit reach the steady state more rapidly or more slowly? Resistors in Series and Equivalent Resistance Now that we have a basic idea of how electrical circuits work, let’s see what happens in circuits with more than one circuit element. In this section, we look at resistors in series. Components connected in series are connected one after the other in the same branch of a circuit, such as the resistors connected in series on the left side of . On the left is an electric circuit with three resistors R1, R2, and R3 connected in series. On the right is an electric circuit with one resistor Requiv that is equivalent to the combination of the three resistors R1, R2, and R3. We will now try to find a single resistance that is equivalent to the three resistors in series on the left side of . An equivalent resistor is a resistor that has the same resistance as the combined resistance of a set of other resistors. In other words, the same current will flow through the left and right circuits in if we use the equivalent resistor in the right circuit. According to Ohm’s law, the voltage drop V across a resistor when a current flows through it is V=IR where I is the current in amperes (A) and R is the resistance in ohms ( Ω ). Another way to think of this is that V is the voltage necessary to make a current I flow through a resistance R. Applying Ohm’s law to each resistor on the left circuit of , we find that the voltage drop across R 1 is V 1 =I R 1 , that across R 2 is V 2 =I R 2 , and that across R 3 is V 3 =I R 3 . The sum of these voltages equals the voltage output of the battery, that is V battery = V 1 + V 2 + V 3 . You may wonder why voltages must add up like this. One way to understand this is to go once around the circuit and add up the successive changes in voltage. If you do this around a loop and get back to the starting point, the total change in voltage should be zero, because you end up at the same place that you started. To better understand this, consider the analogy of going for a stroll through some hilly countryside. If you leave your car and walk around, then come back to your car, the total height you gained in your stroll must be the same as the total height you lost, because you end up at the same place as you started. Thus, the gravitational potential energy you gain must be the same as the gravitational potential energy you lose. The same reasoning holds for voltage in going around an electric circuit. Let’s apply this reasoning to the left circuit in . We start just below the battery and move up through the battery, which contributes a voltage gain of V battery . Next, we got through the resistors. The voltage drops by V 1 in going through resistor R 1 , by V 2 in going through resistor R 2 , and by V 3 in going through resistor R 3 . After going through resistor R 3 , we arrive back at the starting point, so we add up these four changes in voltage and set the sum equal to zero. This gives 0= V battery − V 1 − V 2 − V 3 . which is the same as the previous equation. Note that the minus signs in front of V 1 , V 2 , and V 3 are because these are voltage drops, whereas V battery is a voltage rise. Ohm’s law tells us that V 1 =I R 1 , V 2 =I R 2 , and V 3 =I R 3 . Inserting these values into equation V battery = V 1 + V 2 + V 3 gives V battery = I R 1 +I R 2 +I R 3 = I( R 1 + R 2 + R 3 ). Applying this same logic to the right circuit in gives V battery =I R equiv. Dividing the equation V battery =I( R 1 + R 2 + R 3 ) by V battery =I R equiv , we get V battery V battery = I( R 1 + R 2 + R 3 ) I R equiv R equiv = R 1 + R 2 + R 3 . This shows that the equivalent resistance for a series of resistors is simply the sum of the resistances of each resistor. In general, N resistors connected in series can be replaced by an equivalent resistor with a resistance of R equiv = R 1 + R 2 +⋯+ R N . Resistors in Series This video discusses the basic concepts behind interpreting circuit diagrams and then shows how to calculate the equivalent resistance for resistors in series. True or false—In a circuit diagram, we can assume that the voltage is the same at every point in a given wire. false true Calculation of Equivalent Resistance In the left circuit of the previous figure, suppose the voltage rating of the battery is 12 V, and the resistances are R 1 =1.0Ω, R 2 =6.0Ω,and R 3 =13Ω . (a) What is the equivalent resistance? (b) What is the current through the circuit? Strategy FOR (A) Use the equation for the equivalent resistance of resistors connected in series. Because the circuit has three resistances, we only need to keep three terms, so it takes the form R equiv = R 1 + R 2 + R 3 . Solution for (a) Inserting the given resistances into the equation above gives R equiv = R 1 + R 2 + R 3 = 1.0Ω+6.0Ω+13Ω = 20Ω. Discussion for (a) We can thus replace the three resistors R 1 , R 2 ,and R 3 with a single 20- Ω resistor. Strategy FOR (B) Apply Ohm’s law to the circuit on the right side of the previous figure with the equivalent resistor of 20 Ω . Solution for (b) The voltage drop across the equivalent resistor must be the same as the voltage rise in the battery. Thus, Ohm’s law gives V battery = I R equiv I = V battery R equiv = 12V 20Ω = 0.60A. Discussion for (b) To check that this result is reasonable, we calculate the voltage drop across each resistor and verify that they add up to the voltage rating of the battery. The voltage drop across each resistor is V 1 = I R 1 = ( 0.60A )( 1.0Ω ) = 0.60V V 2 = I R 2 = ( 0.60A )( 6.0Ω ) = 3.6V V 3 = I R 3 = ( 0.60A )( 13Ω ) = 7.8V. Adding these voltages together gives V 1 + V 2 + V 3 =0.60V+3.6V+7.8V=12V. which is the voltage rating of the battery. Determine the Unknown Resistance The circuit shown in figure below contains three resistors of known value and a third element whose resistance R 3 is unknown. Given that the equivalent resistance for the entire circuit is 150 Ω , what is the resistance R 3 ? Strategy The four resistances in this circuit are connected in series, so we know that they must add up to give the equivalent resistance. We can use this to find the unknown resistance R 3 . Solution For four resistances in series, the equation for the equivalent resistance of resistors in series takes the form R equiv = R 1 + R 2 + R 3 + R 4 . Solving for R3 and inserting the known values gives R 3 = R equiv − R 1 − R 2 − R 4 = 150Ω−10Ω−25Ω−15Ω = 100Ω. Discussion The equivalent resistance of a circuit can be measured with an ohmmeter. This is sometimes useful for determining the effective resistance of elements whose resistance is not marked on the element. Check your Understanding What circuit element is represented in the figure above? a battery a resistor a capacitor an inductor Section Summary Circuit diagrams are schematic representations of electric circuits. Resistors in series are resistors that are connected head to tail. The same current runs through all resistors in series; however, the voltage drop across each resistor can be different. The voltage is the same at every point in a given wire.

The student is expected to: (F) design, construct, and calculate in terms of current through, potential difference across, resistance of, and power used by electric circuit elements connected in both series and parallel combinations. Section Key Terms in parallel Resistors in Parallel In the previous section, we learned that resistors in series are resistors that are connected one after the other. If we instead combine resistors by connecting them next to each other, as shown in , then the resistors are said to be connected in parallel. Resistors are in parallel when both ends of each resistor are connected directly together. Note that the tops of the resistors are all connected to the same wire, so the voltage at the top of the each resistor is the same. Likewise, the bottoms of the resistors are all connected to the same wire, so the voltage at the bottom of each resistor is the same. This means that the voltage drop across each resistor is the same. In this case, the voltage drop is the voltage rating V of the battery, because the top and bottom wires connect to the positive and negative terminals of the battery, respectively. Although the voltage drop across each resistor is the same, we cannot say the same for the current running through each resistor. Thus, I 1 , I 2 ,and I 3 are not necessarily the same, because the resistors R 1 , R 2 ,and R 3 do not necessarily have the same resistance. Note that the three resistors in provide three different paths through which the current can flow. This means that the equivalent resistance for these three resistors must be less than the smallest of the three resistors. To understand this, imagine that the smallest resistor is the only path through which the current can flow. Now add on the alternate paths by connecting other resistors in parallel. Because the current has more paths to go through, the overall resistance (i.e., the equivalent resistance) will decrease. Therefore, the equivalent resistance must be less than the smallest resistance of the parallel resistors. The left circuit diagram shows three resistors in parallel. The voltage V of the battery is applied across all three resistors. The currents that flow through each branch are not necessarily equal. The right circuit diagram shows an equivalent resistance that replaces the three parallel resistors. Teacher Support Emphasize that the voltage across each parallel resistor is the same, whereas the current may differ; it will be the same if a pair of resistors has the same resistance. To find the equivalent resistance R equiv of the three resistors R 1 , R 2 ,and R 3 , we apply Ohm’s law to each resistor. Because the voltage drop across each resistor is V, we obtain V= I 1 R 1 , V= I 2 R 2 , V= I 3 R 3 or I 1 = V R 1 , I 2 = V R 2 , I 3 = V R 3 . We also know from conservation of charge that the three currents I 1 , I 2 ,and I 3 must add up to give the current I that goes through the battery. If this were not true, current would have to be mysteriously created or destroyed somewhere in the circuit, which is physically impossible. Thus, we have I= I 1 + I 2 + I 3 . Inserting the expressions for I 1 , I 2 ,and I 3 into this equation gives I= V R 1 + V R 2 + V R 3 =V( 1 R 1 + 1 R 2 + 1 R 3 ) or V=I( 1 1/ R 1 +1/ R 2 +1/ R 3 ) . This formula is just Ohm’s law, with the factor in parentheses being the equivalent resistance. V=I( 1 1/ R 1 +1/ R 2 +1/ R 3 )=I R equiv. Thus, the equivalent resistance for three resistors in parallel is R equiv = 1 1/ R 1 +1/ R 2 +1/ R 3 . The same logic works for any number of resistors in parallel, so the general form of the equation that gives the equivalent resistance of N resistors connected in parallel is R equiv = 1 1/ R 1 +1/ R 2 +⋯+1/ R N . Find the Current through Parallel Resistors The three circuits below are equivalent. If the voltage rating of the battery is V battery =3V , what is the equivalent resistance of the circuit and what current runs through the circuit? Strategy The three resistors are connected in parallel and the voltage drop across them is Vbattery. Thus, we can apply the equation for the equivalent resistance of resistors in parallel, which takes the form R equiv = 1 1/ R 1 +1/ R 2 +1/ R 3 . The circuit with the equivalent resistance is shown below. Once we know the equivalent resistance, we can use Ohm’s law to find the current in the circuit. Solution Inserting the given values for the resistance into the equation for equivalent resistance gives R equiv = 1 1/ R 1 +1/ R 2 +1/ R 3 = 1 1/ 10Ω +1/ 25Ω +1/ 15Ω = 4.84Ω. The current through the circuit is thus V = IR I = V R = 3V 4.84Ω = 0.62A. Discussion Although 0.62 A flows through the entire circuit, note that this current does not flow through each resistor. However, because electric charge must be conserved in a circuit, the sum of the currents going through each branch of the circuit must add up to the current going through the battery. In other words, we cannot magically create charge somewhere in the circuit and add this new charge to the current. Let’s check this reasoning by using Ohm’s law to find the current through each resistor. I 1 = V R 1 = 3V 10Ω =0.30A I 2 = V R 2 = 3V 25Ω =0.12A I 3 = V R 3 = 3V 15Ω =0.20A As expected, these currents add up to give 0.62 A, which is the total current found going through the equivalent resistor. Also, note that the smallest resistor has the largest current flowing through it, and vice versa. Reasoning with Parallel Resistors Without doing any calculation, what is the equivalent resistance of three identical resistors R in parallel? Strategy Three identical resistors R in parallel make three identical paths through which the current can flow. Thus, it is three times easier for the current to flow through these resistors than to flow through a single one of them. Solution If it is three times easier to flow through three identical resistors R than to flow through a single one of them, the equivalent resistance must be three times less: R/3. Discussion Let’s check our reasoning by calculating the equivalent resistance of three identical resistors R in parallel. The equation for the equivalent resistance of resistors in parallel gives R equiv = 1 1/R +1/R +1/R = 1 3/R = R 3 . Thus, our reasoning was correct. In general, when more paths are available through which the current can flow, the equivalent resistance decreases. For example, if we have identical resistors R in parallel, the equivalent resistance would be R/10. Practice Problems Three resistors, 10, 20, and 30 Ω, are connected in parallel. What is the equivalent resistance? The equivalent resistance is 5.5 Ω The equivalent resistance is 60 Ω The equivalent resistance is 6 × 103 Ω The equivalent resistance is 6 × 104 Ω Resistors in Parallel and in Series More complex connections of resistors are sometimes just combinations of series and parallel. Combinations of series and parallel resistors can be reduced to a single equivalent resistance by using the technique illustrated in . Various parts are identified as either series or parallel, reduced to their equivalents, and further reduced until a single resistance is left. The process is more time consuming than difficult. This combination of seven resistors has both series and parallel parts. Each is identified and reduced to an equivalent resistance, and these are further reduced until a single equivalent resistance is reached. Teacher Support Students may be tempted to immediately add R 1 and R 7 together because they appear to be in series. Point out that R 1 is in series with the parallel combination of R 7 and all the resistors to the right of R 7 . Thus, the equivalent resistance of this parallel combination must be found before it can be added to R 1 . Teacher Support Work through this example with students to ensure that they understand the reduction that occurs at each step. Let’s work through the four steps in to reduce the seven resistors to a single equivalent resistor. To avoid distracting algebra, we’ll assume each resistor is 10 Ω . In step 1, we reduce the two sets of parallel resistors circled by the blue dashed loop. The upper set has three resistors in parallel and will be reduced to a single equivalent resistor R P1 . The lower set has two resistors in parallel and will be reduced to a single equivalent resistor R P2 . Using the equation for the equivalent resistance of resistors in parallel, we obtain R P1 = 1 1/ R 2 +1/ R 3 +1/ R 4 = 1 1/ 10Ω+1/ 10Ω+1/ 10Ω = 10 3 Ω R P2 = 1 1/ R 5 +1/ R 6 = 1 1/ 10Ω+1/ 10Ω = 5Ω. These two equivalent resistances are encircled by the red dashed loop following step 1. They are in series, so we can use the equation for the equivalent resistance of resistors in series to reduce them to a single equivalent resistance R S1 . This is done in step 2, with the result being R S1 = R P1 + R P2 = 10 3 Ω+5Ω= 25 3 Ω. The equivalent resistor R S1 appears in the green dashed loop following step 2. This resistor is in parallel with resistor R 7 , so the pair can be replaced by the equivalent resistor R P3 , which is given by R P3 = 1 1/ R S1 +1/ R 7 = 1 3/ 25Ω +1/ 10Ω = 50 11 Ω. This is done in step 3. The resistor R P3 is in series with the resistor R 1 , as shown in the purple dashed loop following step 3. These two resistors are combined in the final step to form the final equivalent resistor R equiv , which is R equiv = R 1 + R P3 =10Ω+ 50 11 Ω= 160 11 Ω. Thus, the entire combination of seven resistors may be replaced by a single resistor with a resistance of about 14.5 Ω .That was a lot of work, and you might be asking why we do it. It’s important for us to know the equivalent resistance of the entire circuit so that we can calculate the current flowing through the circuit. Ohm’s law tells us that the current flowing through a circuit depends on the resistance of the circuit and the voltage across the circuit. But to know the current, we must first know the equivalent resistance. Here is a general approach to find the equivalent resistor for any arbitrary combination of resistors: Identify a group of resistors that are only in parallel or only in series. For resistors in series, use the equation for the equivalent resistance of resistors in series to reduce them to a single equivalent resistance. For resistors in parallel, use the equation for the equivalent resistance of resistors in parallel to reduce them to a single equivalent resistance. Draw a new circuit diagram with the resistors from step 1 replaced by their equivalent resistor. If more than one resistor remains in the circuit, return to step 1 and repeat. Otherwise, you are finished. Robot Robots have captured our collective imagination for over a century. Now, this dream of creating clever machines to do our dirty work, or sometimes just to keep us company, is becoming a reality. Robotics has become a huge field of research and development, with some technology already being commercialized. Think of the small autonomous vacuum cleaners, for example. shows just a few of the multitude of different forms robots can take. The most advanced humanoid robots can walk, pour drinks, even dance (albeit not very gracefully). Other robots are bio-inspired, such as the dogbot shown in the middle photograph of . This robot can carry hundreds of pounds of load over rough terrain. The photograph on the right in shows the inner workings of an M-block, developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. These simple-looking blocks contain inertial wheels and electromagnets that allow them to spin and flip into the air and snap together in a variety of shapes. By communicating wirelessly between themselves, they self-assemble into a variety of shapes, such as desks, chairs, and someday maybe even buildings. All robots involve an immense amount of physics and engineering. The simple act of pouring a drink has only recently been mastered by robots, after over 30 years of research and development! The balance and timing that we humans take for granted is in fact a very tricky act to follow, requiring excellent balance, dexterity, and feedback. To master this requires sensors to detect balance, computing power to analyze the data and communicate the appropriate compensating actions, and joints and actuators to implement the required actions. In addition to sensing gravity or acceleration, robots can contain multiple different sensors to detect light, sound, temperature, smell, taste, etc. These devices are all based on the physical principles that you are studying in this text. For example, the optics used for robotic vision are similar to those used in your digital cameras: pixelated semiconducting detectors in which light is converted into electrical signals. To detect temperature, simple thermistors may be used, which are resistors whose resistance changes depending on temperature. Building a robot today is much less arduous than it was a few years ago. Numerous companies now offer kits for building robots. These range in complexity something suitable for elementary school children to something that would challenge the best professional engineers. If interested, you may find these easily on the Internet and start making your own robot today. Robots come in many shapes and sizes, from the classic humanoid type to dogbots to small cubes that self-assemble to perform a variety of tasks. Resistors in Parallel This video shows a lecturer discussing a simple circuit with a battery and a pair of resistors in parallel. He emphasizes that electrons flow in the direction opposite to that of the positive current and also makes use of the fact that the voltage is the same at all points on an ideal wire. The derivation is quite similar to what is done in this text, but the lecturer goes through it well, explaining each step. True or false—In a circuit diagram, we can assume that the voltage is the same at every point in a given wire. false true Resistors in Series and in Parallel This video shows how to calculate the equivalent resistance of a circuit containing resistors in parallel and in series. The lecturer uses the same approach as outlined above for finding the equivalent resistance. Imagine connected N identical resistors in parallel. Each resistor has a resistance of R. What is the equivalent resistance for this group of parallel resistors? The equivalent resistance is (R)N. The equivalent resistance is NR. The equivalent resistance is R N . The equivalent resistance is N R . Find the Current through a Complex Resistor Circuit The battery in the circuit below has a voltage rating of 10 V. What current flows through the circuit and in what direction? Strategy Apply the Strategy for finding equivalent resistance to replace all the resistors with a single equivalent resistance, then use Ohm’s law to find the current through the equivalent resistor. Solution The resistor combination R 4 and R 5 can be reduced to an equivalent resistance of R P1 = 1 1/ R 4 +1/ R 5 = 1 1/ 45Ω +1/ 60Ω =25.71ΩR. Replacing R 4 and R 5 with this equivalent resistance gives the circuit below. We now replace the two upper resistors R 2 and R 3 by the equivalent resistor R S1 and the two lower resistors R P1 and R 6 by their equivalent resistor R S2 . These resistors are in series, so we add them together to find the equivalent resistance. R S1 = R 2 + R 3 = 50Ω+30Ω = 80Ω R S2 = R P1 + R 6 = 25.71Ω+20Ω = 45.71Ω Replacing the relevant resistors with their equivalent resistor gives the circuit below. Now replace the two resistors R S1 and R S2 , which are in parallel, with their equivalent resistor R P2 . The resistance of R P2 is R P2 = 1 1/ R S1 +1/ R S2 = 1 1/80Ω+1/45.71Ω =29.09Ω. Updating the circuit diagram by replacing R S1 and R S2 with this equivalent resistance gives the circuit below. Finally, we combine resistors R 1 and R P2 , which are in series. The equivalent resistance is R S3 = R 1 + R P2 =75Ω+29.09Ω=104.09Ω. The final circuit is shown below. We now use Ohm’s law to find the current through the circuit. V = I R S3 I = V R S3 = 10V 104.09Ω = 0.096A The current goes from the positive terminal of the battery to the negative terminal of the battery, so it flows clockwise in this circuit. Discussion This calculation may seem rather long, but with a little practice, you can combine some steps. Note also that extra significant digits were carried through the calculation. Only at the end was the final result rounded to two significant digits. Strange-Looking Circuit Diagrams Occasionally, you may encounter circuit diagrams that are not drawn very neatly, such as the diagram shown below. This circuit diagram looks more like how a real circuit might appear on the lab bench. What is the equivalent resistance for the resistors in this diagram, assuming each resistor is 10 Ω and the voltage rating of the battery is 12 V. Strategy Let’s redraw this circuit diagram to make it clearer. Then we’ll apply the Strategy outlined above to calculate the equivalent resistance. Solution To redraw the diagram, consider the figure below. In the upper circuit, the blue resistors constitute a path from the positive terminal of the battery to the negative terminal. In parallel with this circuit are the red resistors, which constitute another path from the positive to negative terminal of the battery. The blue and red paths are shown more cleanly drawn in the lower circuit diagram. Note that, in both the upper and lower circuit diagrams, the blue and red paths connect the positive terminal of the battery to the negative terminal of the battery. Now it is easier to see that R 1 and R 2 are in parallel, and the parallel combination is in series with R 4 . This combination in turn is in parallel with the series combination of R 3 and R 5 . First, we calculate the blue branch, which contains R 1 , R 2 , and R 4 . The equivalent resistance is R blue = 1 1/ R 1 +1/ R 2 + R 4 = 1 1/ 10 Ω+1/ 10Ω +10Ω=15Ω. where we show the contribution from the parallel combination of resistors and from the series combination of resistors. We now calculate the equivalent resistance of the red branch, which is R red = R 3 + R 5 =10Ω+10Ω=20Ω. Inserting these equivalent resistors into the circuit gives the circuit below. These two resistors are in parallel, so they can be replaced by a single equivalent resistor with a resistance of R equiv = 1 1/ R blue +1/ R red = 1 1/ 15Ω +1/ 20Ω =8.6Ω. The final equivalent circuit is show below. Discussion Finding the equivalent resistance was easier with a clear circuit diagram. This is why we try to make clear circuit diagrams, where the resistors in parallel are lined up parallel to each other and at the same horizontal position on the diagram. We can now use Ohm’s law to find the current going through each branch to this circuit. Consider the circuit diagram with R blue and R red . The voltage across each of these branches is 12 V (i.e., the voltage rating of the battery). The current in the blue branch is I blue = V R blue = 12V 15Ω =0.80A. The current across the red branch is I red = V R red = 12V 20Ω =0.60A. The current going through the battery must be the sum of these two currents (can you see why?), or 1.4 A. Practice Problems What is the formula for the equivalent resistance of two parallel resistors with resistance R1 and R2?

The upper limit of the equivalent resistance is 100 Ω. There is no upper limit. Section Summary The equivalent resistance of a group of N identical resistors R connected in parallel is R/N. Connecting resistors in parallel provides more paths for the current to go through, so the equivalent resistance is always less than the smallest resistance of the parallel resistors. The same voltage drop occurs across all resistors in parallel; however, the current through each resistor can differ.

The equivalent resistance of the pair is 8 Ω. What is the resistance R? 10 Ω 20 Ω 30 Ω 40 Ω Are the resistors shown connected in parallel or in series? Explain. The resistors are connected in parallel because the same current flows through all three resistors. The resistors are connected in parallel because different current flows through all three resistors. The resistors are connected in series because the same current flows through all three resistors. The resistors are connected in series because different current flows through all three resistors. Test Prep Short Answer Ten 100-Ω resistors are connected in series. How can you increase the total resistance of the circuit by about 40 percent? Adding two 10-Ω resistors increases the total resistance of the circuit by about 40 percent. Removing two 10-Ω resistors increases the total resistance of the circuit by about 40 percent. Adding four 10-Ω resistors increases the total resistance of the circuit by about 40 percent. Removing four 10-Ω resistors increases the total resistance of the circuit by about 40 percent. In the circuit shown, through which resistor(s) does the most current flow? Through which does the least flow? Explain. The most current flows through the 15-Ω resistor because all the current must pass through this resistor. The most current flows through the 20-Ω resistor because all the current must pass through this resistor. The most current flows through the 25-Ω resistor because it is the highest resistance. The same current flows through the all the resistor because all the current must pass through each of the resistors.

The student knows that changes occur within a physical system and applies the laws of conservation of energy and momentum. The student is expected to: (C) calculate the mechanical energy of, power generated within, impulse applied to, and momentum of a physical system. Section Key Terms electric power Power is associated by many people with electricity. Every day, we use electric power to run our modern appliances. Electric power transmission lines are visible examples of electricity providing power. We also use electric power to start our cars, to run our computers, or to light our homes. Power is the rate at which energy of any type is transferred; electric power is the rate at which electric energy is transferred in a circuit. In this section, we’ll learn not only what this means, but also what factors determine electric power. To get started, let’s think of light bulbs, which are often characterized in terms of their power ratings in watts. Let us compare a 25-W bulb with a 60-W bulb (see ). Although both operate at the same voltage, the 60-W bulb emits more light intensity than the 25-W bulb. This tells us that something other than voltage determines the power output of an electric circuit. Incandescent light bulbs, such as the two shown in , are essentially resistors that heat up when current flows through them and they get so hot that they emit visible and invisible light. Thus the two light bulbs in the photo can be considered as two different resistors. In a simple circuit such as a light bulb with a voltage applied to it, the resistance determines the current by Ohm’s law, so we can see that current as well as voltage must determine the power. On the left is a 25-W light bulb, and on the right is a 60-W light bulb. Why are their power outputs different despite their operating on the same voltage? The formula for power may be found by dimensional analysis. Consider the units of power. In the SI system, power is given in watts (W), which is energy per unit time, or J/s W= J s . Recall now that a voltage is the potential energy per unit charge, which means that voltage has units of J/C V= J C . We can rewrite this equation as J=V×C and substitute this into the equation for watts to get W= J s = V×C s =V× C s . But a Coulomb per second (C/s) is an electric current, which we can see from the definition of electric current, I= ΔQ Δt , where Δ Q is the charge in coulombs and Δ t is time in seconds. Thus, equation above tells us that electric power is voltage times current, or P=IV. This equation gives the electric power consumed by a circuit with a voltage drop of V and a current of I. For example, consider the circuit in . From Ohm’s law, the current running through the circuit is I= V R = 12V 100Ω =0.12A. Thus, the power consumed by the circuit is P=VI=( 12V )( 0.12A )=1.4W. Where does this power go? In this circuit, the power goes primarily into heating the resistor in this circuit. A simple circuit that consumes electric power. In calculating the power in the circuit of , we used the resistance and Ohm’s law to find the current. Ohm’s law gives the current: I=V/R , which we can insert into the equation for electric power to obtain P=IV=( V R )V= V 2 R . This gives the power in terms of only the voltage and the resistance. We can also use Ohm’s law to eliminate the voltage in the equation for electric power and obtain an expression for power in terms of just the current and the resistance. If we write Ohm’s law as V=IR and use this to eliminate V in the equation P=IV , we obtain P=IV=I( IR )= I 2 R. This gives the power in terms of only the current and the resistance. Thus, by combining Ohm’s law with the equation P=IV for electric power, we obtain two more expressions for power: one in terms of voltage and resistance and one in terms of current and resistance. Note that only resistance (not capacitance or anything else), current, and voltage enter into the expressions for electric power. This means that the physical characteristic of a circuit that determines how much power it dissipates is its resistance. Any capacitors in the circuit do not dissipate electric power—on the contrary, capacitors either store electric energy or release electric energy back to the circuit. To clarify how voltage, resistance, current, and power are all related, consider , which shows the formula wheel. The quantities in the center quarter circle are equal to the quantities in the corresponding outer quarter circle. For example, to express a potential V in terms of power and current, we see from the formula wheel that V=P/I . The formula wheel shows how volts, resistance, current, and power are related. The quantities in the inner quarter circles equal the quantities in the corresponding outer quarter circles. Find the Resistance of a Lightbulb A typical older incandescent lightbulb was 60 W. Assuming that 120 V is applied across the lightbulb, what is the current through the lightbulb? Strategy We are given the voltage and the power output of a simple circuit containing a lightbulb, so we can use the equation P=IV to find the current I that flows through the lightbulb. Solution Solving P=IV for the current and inserting the given values for voltage and power gives P = IV I = P V = 60W 120V =0.50A. Thus, a half ampere flows through the lightbulb when 120 V is applied across it. Discussion This is a significant current. Recall that household power is AC and not DC, so the 120 V supplied by household sockets is an alternating power, not a constant power. The 120 V is actually the time-averaged power provided by such sockets. Thus, the average current going through the light bulb over a period of time longer than a few seconds is 0.50 A. Boot Warmers To warm your boots on cold days, you decide to sew a circuit with some resistors into the insole of your boots. You want 10 W of heat output from the resistors in each insole, and you want to run them from two 9-V batteries (connected in series). What total resistance should you put in each insole? Strategy We know the desired power and the voltage (18 V, because we have two 9-V batteries connected in series), so we can use the equation P= V 2 /R to find the requisite resistance. Solution Solving P= V 2 /R for the resistance and inserting the given voltage and power, we obtain P = V 2 R R = V 2 P = ( 18V ) 2 10W =32Ω. Thus, the total resistance in each insole should be 32 Ω. Discussion Let’s see how much current would run through this circuit. We have 18 V applied across a resistance of 32 Ω , so Ohm’s law gives I= V R = 18V 32Ω =0.56A. All batteries have labels that say how much charge they can deliver (in terms of a current multiplied by a time). A typical 9-V alkaline battery can deliver a charge of 565 mA⋅h (so two 9 V batteries deliver 1,130 mA⋅h ), so this heating system would function for a time of t= 1130× 10 −3 A⋅h 0.56A =2.0h. Power through a Branch of a Circuit Each resistor in the circuit below is 30 Ω . What power is dissipated by the middle branch of the circuit? Strategy The middle branch of the circuit contains resistors R 3 and R 5 in series. The voltage across this branch is 12 V. We will first find the equivalent resistance in this branch, and then use P= V 2 /R to find the power dissipated in the branch. Solution The equivalent resistance is R middle = R 3 + R 5 =30Ω+30Ω=60Ω . The power dissipated by the middle branch of the circuit is P middle = V 2 R middle = ( 12V ) 2 60Ω =2.4W. Discussion Let’s see if energy is conserved in this circuit by comparing the power dissipated in the circuit to the power supplied by the battery. First, the equivalent resistance of the left branch is R left = 1 1/ R 1 +1/ R 2 + R 4 = 1 1/ 30Ω +1/ 30Ω +30Ω=45Ω. The power through the left branch is P left = V 2 R left = ( 12V ) 2 45Ω =3.2W. The right branch contains only R 6 , so the equivalent resistance is R right = R 6 =30Ω . The power through the right branch is P right = V 2 R right = ( 12V ) 2 30Ω =4.8W. The total power dissipated by the circuit is the sum of the powers dissipated in each branch. P= P left + P middle + P right =2.4W+3.2W+4.8W=10.4W The power provided by the battery is P=IV. where I is the total current flowing through the battery. We must therefore add up the currents going through each branch to obtain I. The branches contributes currents of I left = V R left = 12V 45Ω = 0.2667A I middle = V R middle = 12V 60Ω = 0.20A I right = V R right = 12V 30Ω = 0.40A. The total current is I= I left + I middle + I right =0.2667A+0.20A+0.40A=0.87A. and the power provided by the battery is P=IV=( 0.87A )( 12V )=10.4W. This is the same power as is dissipated in the resistors of the circuit, which shows that energy is conserved in this circuit.

Capacitors do not dissipate electric power. Electric power is proportional to the voltage and the current in a circuit. Ohm’s law provides two extra expressions for electric power: one that does not involve current and one that does not involve voltage.

Explain. Small resistance, because smaller resistance will lead to the largest power Large resistance, because smaller resistance will lead to the largest power If you double the current through a resistor, by what factor does the power dissipated by the resistor change? Power increases by a factor of two. Power increases by a factor of four. Power increases by a factor of eight. Power increases by a factor of 16.

Performance Task An incandescent light bulb (i.e., an old-fashioned light bulb with a little wire in it) A lightbulb socket to hold the light bulb A variable voltage source An ammeterProcedureScrew the lightbulb into its socket. Connect the positive terminal of the voltage source to the input of the ammeter. Connect the output of the ammeter to one connection of the socket. Connect the other connection of the socket to the negative terminal of the voltage source. Ensure that the voltage source is set to supply DC voltage and that the ammeter is set to measure DC amperes. The desired circuit is shown below. On a piece of paper, make a two-column table with 10 rows. Label the left column volts and the right column current. Adjust the voltage source so that it supplies from between 1 and 10 volts DC. For each voltage, write the voltage in the volts column and the corresponding amperage measured by the ammeter in the current column. Make a plot of volts versus current, that is, a plot with volts on the vertical axis and current on the horizontal axis. Use this data and the plot to answer the following questions: What is the resistance of the lightbulb? What is the range of possible error in your result for the resistance? In a single word, how would you describe the curve formed by the data points? Teacher Support This performance task supports NGSS Practice 4 : Analyzing and interpreting data, and Standard 2K: Communicate valid conclusions supported by the data through various methods such as lab reports, labeled drawings, graphic organizers, journals, summaries, oral reports, and technology-based reports. Once collected, data must be presented in a form that can reveal any patterns and relationships and that allows results to be communicated to others. Because raw data as such have little meaning, a major practice of scientists is to organize and interpret data through tabulating, graphing, or statistical analysis. Such analysis can bring out the meaning of data and their relevance so that they may be used as evidence. Engineers, too, make decisions based on evidence that a given design will work; they rarely rely on trial and error. Engineers often analyze a design by creating a model or prototype and collecting extensive data on how it performs, including under extreme conditions. Analysis of this kind of data not only informs design decisions and enables the prediction or assessment of performance but also helps define or clarify problems, determine economic feasibility, evaluate alternatives, and investigate failures. The curve should be linear and approximately go through the origin of the plot. The resistance of a 100-W, 120-V incandescent lightbulb should be around 144 Ω .

Section Key Terms Curie temperature domain electromagnet electromagnetism ferromagnetic magnetic dipole magnetic field magnetic pole magnetized north pole permanent magnet right-hand rule solenoid south pole Magnets and Magnetization People have been aware of magnets and magnetism for thousands of years. The earliest records date back to ancient times, particularly in the region of Asia Minor called Magnesia—the name of this region is the source of words like magnet. Magnetic rocks found in Magnesia, which is now part of western Turkey, stimulated interest during ancient times. When humans first discovered magnetic rocks, they likely found that certain parts of these rocks attracted bits of iron or other magnetic rocks more strongly than other parts. These areas are called the poles of a magnet. A magnetic pole is the part of a magnet that exerts the strongest force on other magnets or magnetic material, such as iron. For example, the poles of the bar magnet shown in are where the paper clips are concentrated. A bar magnet with paper clips attracted to the two poles. If a bar magnet is suspended so that it rotates freely, one pole of the magnet will always turn toward the north, with the opposite pole facing south. This discovery led to the compass, which is simply a small, elongated magnet mounted so that it can rotate freely. An example of a compass is shown . The pole of the magnet that orients northward is called the north pole, and the opposite pole of the magnet is called the south pole. A compass is an elongated magnet mounted in a device that allows the magnet to rotate freely. The discovery that one particular pole of a magnet orients northward, whereas the other pole orients southward allowed people to identify the north and south poles of any magnet. It was then noticed that the north poles of two different magnets repel each other, and likewise for the south poles. Conversely, the north pole of one magnet attracts the south pole of other magnets. This situation is analogous to that of electric charge, where like charges repel and unlike charges attract. In magnets, we simply replace charge with pole: Like poles repel and unlike poles attract. This is summarized in , which shows how the force between magnets depends on their relative orientation. Depending on their relative orientation, magnet poles will either attract each other or repel each other. Consider again the fact that the pole of a magnet that orients northward is called the north pole of the magnet. If unlike poles attract, then the magnetic pole of Earth that is close to the geographic North Pole must be a magnetic south pole! Likewise, the magnetic pole of Earth that is close to the geographic South Pole must be a magnetic north pole. This situation is depicted in , in which Earth is represented as containing a giant internal bar magnet with its magnetic south pole at the geographic North Pole and vice versa. If we were to somehow suspend a giant bar magnet in space near Earth, then the north pole of the space magnet would be attracted to the south pole of Earth’s internal magnet. This is in essence what happens with a compass needle: Its magnetic north pole is attracted to the magnet south pole of Earth’s internal magnet. Earth can be thought of as containing a giant magnet running through its core. The magnetic south pole of Earth’s magnet is at the geographic North Pole, so the north pole of magnets is attracted to the North Pole, which is how the north pole of magnets got their name. Likewise, the south pole of magnets is attracted to the geographic South Pole of Earth. What happens if you cut a bar magnet in half? Do you obtain one magnet with two south poles and one magnet with two north poles? The answer is no: Each half of the bar magnet has a north pole and a south pole. You can even continue cutting each piece of the bar magnet in half, and you will always obtain a new, smaller magnet with two opposite poles. As shown in , you can continue this process down to the atomic scale, and you will find that even the smallest particles that behave as magnets have two opposite poles. In fact, no experiment has ever found any object with a single magnetic pole, from the smallest subatomic particle such as electrons to the largest objects in the universe such as stars. Because magnets always have two poles, they are referred to as magnetic dipoles—di means two. Below, we will see that magnetic dipoles have properties that are analogous to electric dipoles. All magnets have two opposite poles, from the smallest, such as subatomic particles, to the largest, such as stars. Introduction to Magnetism This video provides an interesting introduction to magnetism and discusses, in particular, how electrons around their atoms contribute to the magnetic effects that we observe. Toward which magnetic pole of Earth is the north pole of a compass needle attracted? The north pole of a compass needle is attracted to the north magnetic pole of Earth, which is located near the geographic North Pole of Earth. The north pole of a compass needle is attracted to the south magnetic pole of Earth, which is located near the geographic North Pole of Earth. The north pole of a compass needle is attracted to the north magnetic pole of Earth, which is located near the geographic South Pole of Earth. The north pole of a compass needle is attracted to the south magnetic pole of Earth, which is located near the geographic South Pole of Earth. Only certain materials, such as iron, cobalt, nickel, and gadolinium, exhibit strong magnetic effects. Such materials are called ferromagnetic, after the Latin word ferrum for iron. Other materials exhibit weak magnetic effects, which are detectable only with sensitive instruments. Not only do ferromagnetic materials respond strongly to magnets—the way iron is attracted to magnets—but they can also be magnetized themselves—that is, they can be induced to be magnetic or made into permanent magnets (). A permanent magnet is simply a material that retains its magnetic behavior for a long time, even when exposed to demagnetizing influences. An unmagnetized piece of iron is placed between two magnets, heated, and then cooled, or simply tapped when cold. The iron becomes a permanent magnet with the poles aligned as shown: Its south pole is adjacent to the north pole of the original magnet, and its north pole is adjacent to the south pole of the original magnet. Note that attractive forces are created between the central magnet and the outer magnets. When a magnet is brought near a previously unmagnetized ferromagnetic material, it causes local magnetization of the material with unlike poles closest, as in the right side of . This causes an attractive force, which is why unmagnetized iron is attracted to a magnet. What happens on a microscopic scale is illustrated in Figure 7(a). Regions within the material called domains act like small bar magnets. Within domains, the magnetic poles of individual atoms are aligned. Each atom acts like a tiny bar magnet. Domains are small and randomly oriented in an unmagnetized ferromagnetic object. In response to an external magnetic field, the domains may grow to millimeter size, aligning themselves, as shown in Figure 7(b). This induced magnetization can be made permanent if the material is heated and then cooled, or simply tapped in the presence of other magnets. (a) An unmagnetized piece of iron—or other ferromagnetic material—has randomly oriented domains. (b) When magnetized by an external magnet, the domains show greater alignment, and some grow at the expense of others. Individual atoms are aligned within domains; each atom acts like a tiny bar magnet. Conversely, a permanent magnet can be demagnetized by hard blows or by heating it in the absence of another magnet. Increased thermal motion at higher temperature can disrupt and randomize the orientation and size of the domains. There is a well-defined temperature for ferromagnetic materials, which is called the Curie temperature, above which they cannot be magnetized. The Curie temperature for iron is 1,043 K (770 °C ), which is well above room temperature. There are several elements and alloys that have Curie temperatures much lower than room temperature and are ferromagnetic only below those temperatures. Refrigerator Magnets We know that like magnetic poles repel and unlike poles attract. See if you can show this for two refrigerator magnets. Will the magnets stick if you turn them over? Why do they stick to the refrigerator door anyway? What can you say about the magnetic properties of the refrigerator door near the magnet? Do refrigerator magnets stick to metal or plastic spoons? Do they stick to all types of metal? Teacher Support Holding a magnetic close to an unmagnetized ferromagnetic material will magnetically polarize the ferromagnetic material, causing the atomic magnetic dipoles to orient towards the external magnet. This is similar to electric polarization. Thus, the ferromagnetic material becomes magnetized in the presence of the external magnet, and the two magnets attract each other. For a magnet to stick to the refrigerator door, the door must contain some ferromagnetic material. Magnets will stick to ferrous spoons, for example spoons with iron in them, but not to nonferrous spoons, such as spoons made from Al or Ag, and will not stick to a magnet. Magnets will also not stick to plastic spoons. You have one magnet with the north and south poles labeled. How can you use this magnet to identify the north and south poles of other magnets? If the north pole of a known magnet is repelled by a pole of an unknown magnet on bringing them closer, that pole of unknown magnet is its north pole; otherwise, it is its south pole. If the north pole of known magnet is attracted to a pole of an unknown magnet on bringing them closer, that pole of unknown magnet is its north pole; otherwise, it is its south pole. Magnetic Fields We have thus seen that forces can be applied between magnets and between magnets and ferromagnetic materials without any contact between the objects. This is reminiscent of electric forces, which also act over distances. Electric forces are described using the concept of the electric field, which is a force field around electric charges that describes the force on any other charge placed in the field. Likewise, a magnet creates a magnetic field around it that describes the force exerted on other magnets placed in the field. As with electric fields, the pictorial representation of magnetic field lines is very useful for visualizing the strength and direction of the magnetic field. As shown in , the direction of magnetic field lines is defined to be the direction in which the north pole of a compass needle points. If you place a compass near the north pole of a magnet, the north pole of the compass needle will be repelled and point away from the magnet. Thus, the magnetic field lines point away from the north pole of a magnet and toward its south pole. The black lines represent the magnetic field lines of a bar magnet. The field lines point in the direction that the north pole of a small compass would point, as shown at left. Magnetic field lines never stop, so the field lines actually penetrate the magnet to form complete loops, as shown at right. Magnetic field lines can be mapped out using a small compass. The compass is moved from point to point around a magnet, and at each point, a short line is drawn in the direction of the needle, as shown in . Joining the lines together then reveals the path of the magnetic field line. Another way to visualize magnetic field lines is to sprinkle iron filings around a magnet. The filings will orient themselves along the magnetic field lines, forming a pattern such as that shown on the right in . Using a Compass to Map Out the Magnetic Field This simulation presents you with a bar magnet and a small compass. Begin by dragging the compass around the bar magnet to see in which direction the magnetic field points. Note that the strength of the magnetic field is represented by the brightness of the magnetic field icons in the grid pattern around the magnet. Use the magnetic field meter to check the field strength at several points around the bar magnet. You can also flip the polarity of the magnet, or place Earth on the image to see how the compass orients itself. With the slider at the top right of the simulation window, set the magnetic field strength to 100 percent . Now use the magnetic field meter to answer the following question: Near the magnet, where is the magnetic field strongest and where is it weakest? Don’t forget to check inside the bar magnet. The magnetic field is strongest at the center and weakest between the two poles just outside the bar magnet. The magnetic field lines are densest at the center and least dense between the two poles just outside the bar magnet. The magnetic field is strongest at the center and weakest between the two poles just outside the bar magnet. The magnetic field lines are least dense at the center and densest between the two poles just outside the bar magnet. The magnetic field is weakest at the center and strongest between the two poles just outside the bar magnet. The magnetic field lines are densest at the center and least dense between the two poles just outside the bar magnet. The magnetic field is weakest at the center and strongest between the two poles just outside the bar magnet and the magnetic field lines are least dense at the center and densest between the two poles just outside the bar magnet. Magnetic field lines can be drawn by moving a small compass from point to point around a magnet. At each point, draw a short line in the direction of the compass needle. Joining the points together reveals the path of the magnetic field lines. Another way to visualize magnetic field lines is to sprinkle iron filings around a magnet, as shown at right. When two magnets are brought close together, the magnetic field lines are perturbed, just as happens for electric field lines when two electric charges are brought together. Bringing two north poles together—or two south poles—will cause a repulsion, and the magnetic field lines will bend away from each other. This is shown in , which shows the magnetic field lines created by the two closely separated north poles of a bar magnet. When opposite poles of two magnets are brought together, the magnetic field lines join together and become denser between the poles. This situation is shown in . (a) When two north poles are approached together, the magnetic field lines repel each other and the two magnets experience a repulsive force. The same occurs if two south poles are approached together. (b) If opposite poles are approached together, the magnetic field lines become denser between the poles and the magnets experience an attractive force. Like the electric field, the magnetic field is stronger where the lines are denser. Thus, between the two north poles in , the magnetic field is very weak because the density of the magnetic field is almost zero. A compass placed at that point would essentially spin freely if we ignore Earth’s magnetic field. Conversely, the magnetic field lines between the north and south poles in are very dense, indicating that the magnetic field is very strong in this region. A compass placed here would quickly align with the magnetic field and point toward the south pole on the right. Teacher Support The density of the magnetic field lines in indicates the magnitude of the force that would be applied to a small test magnet placed in this field. The density does not indicate the force between the two magnets that create the field. The magnitude of the force between the two magnets is the same in both cases in . This can be understood by imagining that you place one of the magnets in the field of the other magnet. This situation is symmetrical: The magnetic fields look the same—other than direction—for both situations shown in . Because the magnets are of equal strength, they perturb the magnetic field of the opposite magnet, which is why the magnetic field must be probed by a small magnetic such as, a compass. Note that magnets are not the only things that make magnetic fields. Early in the nineteenth century, people discovered that electrical currents cause magnetic effects. The first significant observation was by the Danish scientist Hans Christian Oersted (1777–1851), who found that a compass needle was deflected by a current-carrying wire. This was the first significant evidence that the movement of electric charges had any connection with magnets. An electromagnet is a device that uses electric current to make a magnetic field. These temporarily induced magnets are called electromagnets. Electromagnets are employed for everything from a wrecking yard crane that lifts scrapped cars to controlling the beam of a 90-km-circumference particle accelerator to the magnets in medical-imaging machines (see ). Instrument for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The device uses a cylindrical-coil electromagnet to produce for the main magnetic field. The patient goes into the tunnel on the gurney. (credit: Bill McChesney, Flickr)The magnetic field created by an electric current in a long straight wire is shown in . The magnetic field lines form concentric circles around the wire. The direction of the magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand rule. This rule shows up in several places in the study of electricity and magnetism. Applied to a straight current-carrying wire, the right-hand rule says that, with your right thumb pointed in the direction of the current, the magnetic field will be in the direction in which your right fingers curl, as shown in . If the wire is very long compared to the distance r from the wire, the strength B of the magnetic field is given by B straightwire = μ 0 I 2πr where I is the current in the wire in amperes. The SI unit for magnetic field is the tesla (T). The symbol μ 0 —read “mu-zero”—is a constant called the “permeability of free space” and is given by μ 0 =4π× 10 −7 T⋅m/A. This image shows how to use the right-hand rule to determine the direction of the magnetic field created by current flowing through a straight wire. Point your right thumb in the direction of the current, and the magnetic field will be in the direction in which your fingers curl. Magnetic Field Due to an Electric Current This video describes the magnetic field created by a straight current-carrying wire. It goes over the right-hand rule to determine the direction of the magnetic field, and presents and discusses the formula for the strength of the magnetic field due to a straight current-carrying wire. A long straight wire is placed on a table top and electric current flows through the wire from right to left. If you look at the wire end-on from the left end, does the magnetic field go clockwise or counterclockwise? By pointing your right-hand thumb in the direction opposite of current, the right-hand fingers will curl counterclockwise, so the magnetic field will be in the counterclockwise direction. By pointing your right-hand thumb in the direction opposite of current, the right-hand fingers will curl clockwise, so the magnetic field will be in the clockwise direction. By pointing your right-hand thumb in the direction of current, the right-hand fingers will curl counterclockwise, so the magnetic field will be in the counterclockwise direction. By pointing your right-hand thumb in the direction of current, the right-hand fingers will curl clockwise, so the magnetic field will be in the clockwise direction. Now imagine winding a wire around a cylinder with the cylinder then removed. The result is a wire coil, as shown in . This is called a solenoid. To find the direction of the magnetic field produced by a solenoid, apply the right-hand rule to several points on the coil. You should be able to convince yourself that, inside the coil, the magnetic field points from left to right. In fact, another application of the right-hand rule is to curl your right-hand fingers around the coil in the direction in which the current flows. Your right thumb then points in the direction of the magnetic field inside the coil: left to right in this case. A wire coil with current running through as shown produces a magnetic field in the direction of the red arrow. Each loop of wire contributes to the magnetic field inside the solenoid. Because the magnetic field lines must form closed loops, the field lines close the loop outside the solenoid. The magnetic field lines are much denser inside the solenoid than outside the solenoid. The resulting magnetic field looks very much like that of a bar magnet, as shown in . The magnetic field strength deep inside a solenoid is B solenoid = μ 0 NI ℓ , where N is the number of wire loops in the solenoid and ℓ is the length of the solenoid. Iron filings show the magnetic field pattern around (a) a solenoid and (b) a bar magnet. The fields patterns are very similar, especially near the ends of the solenoid and bar magnet. Electromagnets Use this simulation to visualize the magnetic field made from a solenoid. Be sure to click on the tab that says Electromagnet. You can drive AC or DC current through the solenoid by choosing the appropriate current source. Use the field meter to measure the strength of the magnetic field and then change the number of loops in the solenoid to see how this affects the magnetic field strength. Magnetic Force If a moving electric charge, that is electric current, produces a magnetic field that can exert a force on another magnet, then the reverse should be true by Newton’s third law. In other words, a charge moving through the magnetic field produced by another object should experience a force—and this is exactly what we find. As a concrete example, consider , which shows a charge q moving with velocity v → through a magnetic field B → between the poles of a permanent magnet. The magnitude F of the force experienced by this charge is F=qvBsinθ, where θ is the angle between the velocity of the charge and the magnetic field. From this equation, we can see that the SI unit of magnetic field, the Tesla, is the magnetic field required to produce a 1 N force on a 1 C charge moving at 1 m/s in a direction perpendicular to the field and equivalent to the following: T=(N⋅s)(C⋅m). The direction of the force may be found by using another version of the right-hand rule: First, we join the tails of the velocity vector and a magnetic field vector, as shown in step 1 of . We then curl our right fingers from v → to B → , as indicated in step (2) of . The direction in which the right thumb points is the direction of the force. For the charge in , we find that the force is directed into the page. Note that the factor sinθ in the equation F=qvBsinθ means that zero force is applied on a charge that moves parallel to a magnetic field because θ=0 and sin0=0 . The maximum force a charge can experience is when it moves perpendicular to the magnetic field, because θ=90° and sin90°=1. (a) A proton moves through a uniform magnetic field. (b) Using the right-hand rule, the force on the proton is found to be directed into the page. Magnetohydrodynamic Drive In Tom Clancy’s Cold War novel “The Hunt for Red October,” the Soviet Union built a submarine (see ) with a magnetohydrodynamic drive that was so silent it could not be detected by surface ships. The only conceivable purpose to build such a submarine was to give the Soviet Union first-strike capability, because this submarine could sneak close to the coast of the United States and fire its ballistic missiles, destroying key military and government installations to prevent an American counterattack. A Typhoon-class Russian ballistic-missile submarine on which the fictional submarine Red October was based. A magnetohydrodynamic drive is supposed to be silent because it has no moving parts. Instead, it uses the force experienced by charged particles that move in a magnetic field. The basic idea behind such a drive is depicted in . Salt water flows through a channel that runs from the front to the back of the submarine. A magnetic field is applied horizontally across the channel, and a voltage is applied across the electrodes on the top and bottom of the channel to force a downward electric current through the water. The charge carriers are the positive sodium ions and the negative chlorine ions of salt. Using the right-hand rule, the force on the charge carriers is found to be toward the rear of the vessel. The accelerated charges collide with water molecules and transfer their momentum, creating a jet of water that is propelled out the rear of the channel. By Newton’s third law, the vessel experiences a force of equal magnitude, but in the opposite direction. A schematic drawing of a magnetohydrodynamic drive showing the water channel, the current direction, the magnetic field direction, and the resulting force. Fortunately for all involved, it turns out that such a propulsion system is not very practical. Some back-of-the-envelope calculations show that, to power a submarine, either extraordinarily high magnetic fields or extraordinarily high electric currents would be required to obtain a reasonable thrust. In addition, prototypes of magnetohydrodynamic drives show that they are anything but silent. Electrolysis caused by running a current through salt water creates bubbles of hydrogen and oxygen, which makes this propulsion system quite noisy. The system also leaves a trail of chloride ions and metal chlorides that can easily be detected to locate the submarine. Finally, the chloride ions are extremely reactive and very quickly corrode metal parts, such as the electrode or the water channel itself. Thus, the Red October remains in the realm of fiction, but the physics involved is quite real. Instead of a single charge moving through a magnetic field, consider now a steady current I moving through a straight wire. If we place this wire in a uniform magnetic field, as shown in , what is the force on the wire or, more precisely, on the electrons in the wire? An electric current involves charges that move. If the charges q move a distance ℓ in a time t, then their speed is v=ℓ/t. Inserting this into the equation F=qvBsinθ gives F = q( ℓ t )Bsinθ = ( q t )ℓBsinθ. The factor q/t in this equation is nothing more than the current in the wire. Thus, using I=q/t , we obtain F=IℓBsinθ(1.4). This equation gives the force on a straight current-carrying wire of length ℓ in a magnetic field of strength B. The angle θ is the angle between the current vector and the magnetic field vector. Note that ℓ is the length of wire that is in the magnetic field and for which θ≠0, as shown in . The direction of the force is determined in the same way as for a single charge. Curl your right fingers from the vector for I to the vector for B, and your right thumb will point in the direction of the force on the wire. For the wire shown in , the force is directed into the page. A straight wire carrying current I in a magnetic field B. The force exerted on the wire is directed into the page. The length ℓ is the length of the wire that is in the magnetic field. Throughout this section, you may have noticed the symmetries between magnetic effects and electric effects. These effects all fall under the umbrella of electromagnetism, which is the study of electric and magnetic phenomena. We have seen that electric charges produce electric fields, and moving electric charges produce magnetic fields. A magnetic dipole produces a magnetic field, and, as we will see in the next section, moving magnetic dipoles produce an electric field. Thus, electricity and magnetism are two intimately related and symmetric phenomena. Trajectory of Electron in Magnetic Field A proton enters a region of constant magnetic field, as shown in . The magnetic field is coming out of the page. If the electron is moving at 3.0× 10 6 m/s and the magnetic field strength is 2.0 T, what is the magnitude and direction of the force on the proton? A proton enters a region of uniform magnetic field. The magnetic field is coming out of the page—the circles with dots represent vector arrow heads coming out of the page. Strategy Use the equation F=qvBsinθ to find the magnitude of the force on the proton. The angle between the magnetic field vectors and the velocity vector of the proton is 90°. The direction of the force may be found by using the right-hand rule. Solution The charge of the proton is q=1.60× 10 −19 C . Entering this value and the given velocity and magnetic field strength into the equation F=qvBsinθ gives F = qvBsinθ = ( 1.60× 10 −19 C )( 3.0× 10 6 m/s )( 2.0T )sin( 90° ) = 9.6× 10 −13 N. To find the direction of the force, first join the velocity vector end to end with the magnetic field vector, as shown in . Now place your right hand so that your fingers point in the direction of the velocity and curl them upward toward the magnetic field vector. The force is in the direction in which your thumb points. In this case, the force is downward in the plane of the paper in the z ^ -direction, as shown in . The velocity vector and a magnetic field vector from are placed end to end. A right hand is shown with the fingers curling up from the velocity vector toward the magnetic field vector. The thumb points in the direction of the resulting force, which is the z ^ -direction in this case. Thus, combining the magnitude and the direction, we find that the force on the proton is ( 9.6× 10 −13 N ) z ^ . Discussion This seems like a very small force. However, the proton has a mass of 1.67× 10 −27 kg , so its acceleration is a= F m = 9.6× 10 −13 N 1.67× 10 −27 kg =5.7× 10 14 m/s 2 , or about ten thousand billion times the acceleration due to gravity! We found that the proton’s initial acceleration as it enters the magnetic field is downward in the plane of the page. Notice that, as the proton accelerates, its velocity remains perpendicular to the magnetic field, so the magnitude of the force does not change. In addition, because of the right-hand rule, the direction of the force remains perpendicular to the velocity. This force is nothing more than a centripetal force: It has a constant magnitude and is always perpendicular to the velocity. Thus, the magnitude of the velocity does not change, and the proton executes circular motion. The radius of this circle may be found by using the kinematics relationship. F = ma=m v 2 r a = v 2 r r = v 2 a = ( 3.0× 10 6 m/s ) 2 5.7× 10 14 m/s 2 =1.6cm The path of the proton in the magnetic field is shown in . When traveling perpendicular to a constant magnetic field, a charged particle will execute circular motion, as shown here for a proton. Wire with Current in Magnetic Field Now suppose we run a wire through the uniform magnetic field from the previous example, as shown. If the wire carries a current of 1.5 A in the y ^ -direction, and the region with magnetic field is 4.0 cm long, what is the force on the wire? Strategy Use equation F=IℓBsinθ to find the magnitude of the force on the wire. The length of the wire inside the magnetic field is 4.0 cm, and the angle between the current direction and the magnetic field direction is 90°. To find the direction of the force, use the right-hand rule as explained just after the equation F=IℓBsinθ. Solution Insert the given values into equation F=IℓBsinθ to find the magnitude of the force F=IℓBsinθ=( 1.5A )( 0.040m )( 2.0T )=0.12N. To find the direction of the force, begin by placing the current vector end to end with a vector for the magnetic field. The result is as shown in the figure in the previous Worked Example with v → replaced by I → . Curl your right-hand fingers from I → to B → and your right thumb points down the page, again as shown in the figure in the previous Worked Example. Thus, the direction of the force is in the x ^ -direction. The complete force is thus ( 0.12N ) x ^ . Discussion The direction of the force is the same as the initial direction of the force was in the previous example for a proton. However, because the current in a wire is confined to a wire, the direction in which the charges move does not change. Instead, the entire wire accelerates in the x ^ -direction. The force on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field is the basis of all electrical motors, as we will see in the upcoming sections.

If the magnet is free to move, its north pole orients itself toward the geographic North Pole of Earth, and the south pole orients itself toward the geographic South Pole of Earth. A repulsive force occurs between the north poles of two magnets and likewise for two south poles. However, an attractive force occurs between the north pole of one magnet and the south pole of another magnet. A charged particle moving through a magnetic field experiences a force whose direction is determined by the right-hand rule. An electric current generates a magnetic field. Electromagnets are magnets made by passing a current through a system of wires.

The student is expected to: (G) investigate and describe the relationship between electric and magnetic fields in applications such as generators, motors, and transformers. Section Key Terms electric motor generator transformer Electric Motors, Generators, and Transformers As we learned previously, a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field experiences a force—recall F=IℓBsinθ . Electric motors, which convert electrical energy into mechanical energy, are the most common application of magnetic force on current-carrying wires. Motors consist of loops of wire in a magnetic field. When current is passed through the loops, the magnetic field exerts a torque on the loops, which rotates a shaft. Electrical energy is converted to mechanical work in the process. shows a schematic drawing of an electric motor. Torque on a current loop. A vertical loop of wire in a horizontal magnetic field is attached to a vertical shaft. When current is passed through the wire loop, torque is exerted on it, making it turn the shaft. Let us examine the force on each segment of the loop in to find the torques produced about the axis of the vertical shaft—this will lead to a useful equation for the torque on the loop. We take the magnetic field to be uniform over the rectangular loop, which has width w and height ℓ , as shown in the figure. First, consider the force on the top segment of the loop. To determine the direction of the force, we use the right-hand rule. The current goes from left to right into the page, and the magnetic field goes from left to right in the plane of the page. Curl your right fingers from the current vector to the magnetic field vector and your right thumb points down. Thus, the force on the top segment is downward, which produces no torque on the shaft. Repeating this analysis for the bottom segment—neglect the small gap where the lead wires go out—shows that the force on the bottom segment is upward, again producing no torque on the shaft. Consider now the left vertical segment of the loop. Again using the right-hand rule, we find that the force exerted on this segment is perpendicular to the magnetic field, as shown in . This force produces a torque on the shaft. Repeating this analysis on the right vertical segment of the loop shows that the force on this segment is in the direction opposite that of the force on the left segment, thereby producing an equal torque on the shaft. The total torque on the shaft is thus twice the toque on one of the vertical segments of the loop. To find the magnitude of the torque as the wire loop spins, consider , which shows a view of the wire loop from above. Recall that torque is defined as τ=rFsinθ , where F is the applied force, r is the distance from the pivot to where the force is applied, and θ is the angle between r and F. Notice that, as the loop spins, the current in the vertical loop segments is always perpendicular to the magnetic field. Thus, the equation F=IℓBsinθ gives the magnitude of the force on each vertical segment as F=IℓB . The distance r from the shaft to where this force is applied is w/2, so the torque created by this force is τ segment =rFsinθ=w/2 IℓBsinθ=( w/2 )IℓBsinθ . Because there are two vertical segments, the total torque is twice this, or τ=wIℓBsinθ . If we have a multiple loop with N turns, we get N times the torque of a single loop. Using the fact that the area of the loop is A=wℓ ; the expression for the torque becomes τ=NIABsinθ . This is the torque on a current-carrying loop in a uniform magnetic field. This equation can be shown to be valid for a loop of any shape. View from above of the wire loop from . The magnetic field generates a force F on each vertical segment of the wire loop, which generates a torque on the shaft. Notice that the currents I in and I out have the same magnitude because they both represent the current flowing in the wire loop, but I in flows into the page and I out flows out of the page. From the equation τ=NIABsinθ , we see that the torque is zero when θ=0 . As the wire loop rotates, the torque increases to a maximum positive torque of wℓB when θ=90° . The torque then decreases back to zero as the wire loop rotates to θ=180° . From θ=180° to θ=360° , the torque is negative. Thus, the torque changes sign every half turn, so the wire loop will oscillate back and forth. For the coil to continue rotating in the same direction, the current is reversed as the coil passes through θ=0andθ=180° using automatic switches called brushes, as shown in . (a) As the angular momentum of the coil carries it through θ=0 , the brushes reverse the current and the torque remains clockwise. (b) The coil rotates continuously in the clockwise direction, with the current reversing each half revolution to maintain the clockwise torque. Consider now what happens if we run the motor in reverse; that is, we attach a handle to the shaft and mechanically force the coil to rotate within the magnetic field, as shown in . As per the equation F=qvBsinθ —where θ is the angle between the vectors v → and B → —charges in the wires of the loop experience a magnetic force because they are moving in a magnetic field. Again using the right-hand rule, where we curl our fingers from vector v → to vector B → , we find that charges in the top and bottom segments feel a force perpendicular to the wire, which does not cause a current. However, charges in the vertical wires experience forces parallel to the wire, causing a current to flow through the wire and through an external circuit if one is connected. A device such as this that converts mechanical energy into electrical energy is called a generator. When this coil is rotated through one-fourth of a revolution, the magnetic flux Φ changes from its maximum to zero, inducing an emf, which drives a current through an external circuit. Because current is induced only in the side wires, we can find the induced emf by only considering these wires. As explained in Induced Current in a Wire, motional emf in a straight wire moving at velocity v through a magnetic field B is ε=Bℓv , where the velocity is perpendicular to the magnetic field. In the generator, the velocity makes an angle θ with B (see ), so the velocity component perpendicular to B is vsinθ . Thus, in this case, the emf induced on each vertical wire segment is ε=Bℓvsinθ , and they are in the same direction. The total emf around the loop is then ε=2Bℓvsinθ . Although this expression is valid, it does not give the emf as a function of time. To find how the emf evolves in time, we assume that the coil is rotated at a constant angular velocity ω . The angle θ is related to the angular velocity by θ=ωt , so that ε=2Bℓvsinωt . Recall that tangential velocity v is related to angular velocity ω by v=rω . Here, r=w/2 , so that v=( w/2 )ω and ε=2Bℓ( w 2 ω )sinωt=Bℓwωsinωt . Noting that the area of the loop is A=ℓw and allowing for N wire loops, we find that ε=NABωsinωt is the emf induced in a generator coil of N turns and area A rotating at a constant angular velocity ω in a uniform magnetic field B. This can also be expressed as ε= ε 0 sinωt where ε 0 =NABω is the maximum (peak) emf. The instantaneous velocity of the vertical wire segments makes an angle θ with the magnetic field. The velocity is shown in the figure by the green arrow, and the angle θ is indicated. shows a generator connected to a light bulb and a graph of the emf vs. time. Note that the emf oscillates from a positive maximum of ε 0 to a negative maximum of −E 0 . In between, the emf goes through zero, which means that zero current flows through the light bulb at these times. Thus, the light bulb actually flickers on and off at a frequency of 2f, because there are two zero crossings per period. Since alternating current such as this is used in homes around the world, why do we not notice the lights flickering on and off? In the United States, the frequency of alternating current is 60 Hz, so the lights flicker on and off at a frequency of 120 Hz. This is faster than the refresh rate of the human eye, so you don’t notice the flicker of the lights. Also, other factors prevent various different types of light bulbs from switching on and off so fast, so the light output is smoothed out a bit. The emf of a generator is sent to a light bulb with the system of rings and brushes shown. The graph gives the emf of the generator as a function of time. ε 0 is the peak emf. The period is T=1/f = 2π /ω , where f is the frequency at which the coil is rotated in the magnetic field. Generator Use this simulation to discover how an electrical generator works. Control the water supply that makes a water wheel turn a magnet. This induces an emf in a nearby wire coil, which is used to light a light bulb. You can also replace the light bulb with a voltmeter, which allows you to see the polarity of the voltage, which changes from positive to negative. Set the number of wire loops to three, the bar-magnet strength to about 50 percent, and the loop area to 100 percent. Note the maximum voltage on the voltmeter. Assuming that one major division on the voltmeter is 5V, what is the maximum voltage when using only a single wire loop instead of three wire loops? 5 V 15 V 125 V 53 V In real life, electric generators look a lot different than the figures in this section, but the principles are the same. The source of mechanical energy that turns the coil can be falling water—hydropower—steam produced by the burning of fossil fuels, or the kinetic energy of wind. shows a cutaway view of a steam turbine; steam moves over the blades connected to the shaft, which rotates the coil within the generator. Steam turbine generator. The steam produced by burning coal impacts the turbine blades, turning the shaft which is connected to the generator. (credit: Nabonaco, Wikimedia Commons) Another very useful and common device that exploits magnetic induction is called a transformer. Transformers do what their name implies—they transform voltages from one value to another; the term voltage is used rather than emf because transformers have internal resistance. For example, many cell phones, laptops, video games, power tools, and small appliances have a transformer built into their plug-in unit that changes 120 V or 240 V AC into whatever voltage the device uses. shows two different transformers. Notice the wire coils that are visible in each device. The purpose of these coils is explained below. On the left is a common laminated-core transformer, which is widely used in electric power transmission and electrical appliances. On the right is a toroidal transformer, which is smaller than the laminated-core transformer for the same power rating but is more expensive to make because of the equipment required to wind the wires in the doughnut shape. shows a laminated-coil transformer, which is based on Faraday’s law of induction and is very similar in construction to the apparatus Faraday used to demonstrate that magnetic fields can generate electric currents. The two wire coils are called the primary and secondary coils. In normal use, the input voltage is applied across the primary coil, and the secondary produces the transformed output voltage. Not only does the iron core trap the magnetic field created by the primary coil, but also its magnetization increases the field strength, which is analogous to how a dielectric increases the electric field strength in a capacitor. Since the input voltage is AC, a time-varying magnetic flux is sent through the secondary coil, inducing an AC output voltage. A typical construction of a simple transformer has two coils wound on a ferromagnetic core. The magnetic field created by the primary coil is mostly confined to and increased by the core, which transmits it to the secondary coil. Any change in current in the primary coil induces a current in the secondary coil. Magnetic Rope Memory To send men to the moon, the Apollo program had to design an onboard computer system that would be robust, consume little power, and be small enough to fit onboard the spacecraft. In the 1960s, when the Apollo program was launched, entire buildings were regularly dedicated to housing computers whose computing power would be easily outstripped by today’s most basic handheld calculator. To address this problem, engineers at MIT and a major defense contractor turned to magnetic rope memory, which was an offshoot of a similar technology used prior to that time for creating random access memories. Unlike random access memory, magnetic rope memory was read-only memory that contained not only data but instructions as well. Thus, it was actually more than memory: It was a hard-wired computer program. The components of magnetic rope memory were wires and iron rings—which were called cores. The iron cores served as transformers, such as that shown in the previous figure. However, instead of looping the wires multiple times around the core, individual wires passed only a single time through the cores, making these single-turn transformers. Up to 63 word wires could pass through a single core, along with a single bit wire. If a word wire passed through a given core, a voltage pulse on this wire would induce an emf in the bit wire, which would be interpreted as a one. If the word wire did not pass through the core, no emf would be induced on the bit wire, which would be interpreted as a zero. Engineers would create programs that would be hard wired into these magnetic rope memories. The wiring process could take as long as a month to complete as workers painstakingly threaded wires through some cores and around others. If any mistakes were made either in the programming or the wiring, debugging would be extraordinarily difficult, if not impossible. These modules did their job quite well. They are credited with correcting an astronaut mistake in the lunar landing procedure, thereby allowing Apollo 11 to land on the moon. It is doubtful that Michael Faraday ever imagined such an application for magnetic induction when he discovered it. For the transformer shown in , the output voltage V S from the secondary coil depends almost entirely on the input voltage V P across the primary coil and the number of loops in the primary and secondary coils. Faraday’s law of induction for the secondary coil gives its induced output voltage V S to be V S =− N S ΔΦ Δt , where N S is the number of loops in the secondary coil and ΔΦ / Δt is the rate of change of magnetic flux. The output voltage equals the induced emf ( V S = ε S ), provided coil resistance is small—a reasonable assumption for transformers. The cross-sectional area of the coils is the same on each side, as is the magnetic field strength, and so ΔΦ/Δt is the same on each side. The input primary voltage V P is also related to changing flux by V P =− N P ΔΦ Δt . Taking the ratio of these last two equations yields the useful relationship V S V P = N S N P ( 3.07 ) . This is known as the transformer equation. It simply states that the ratio of the secondary voltage to the primary voltage in a transformer equals the ratio of the number of loops in secondary coil to the number of loops in the primary coil. Transmission of Electrical Power Transformers are widely used in the electric power industry to increase voltages—called step-up transformers—before long-distance transmission via high-voltage wires. They are also used to decrease voltages—called step-down transformers—to deliver power to homes and businesses. The overwhelming majority of electric power is generated by using magnetic induction, whereby a wire coil or copper disk is rotated in a magnetic field. The primary energy required to rotate the coils or disk can be provided by a variety of means. Hydroelectric power plants use the kinetic energy of water to drive electric generators. Coal or nuclear power plants create steam to drive steam turbines that turn the coils. Other sources of primary energy include wind, tides, or waves on water. Once power is generated, it must be transmitted to the consumer, which often means transmitting power over hundreds of kilometers. To do this, the voltage of the power plant is increased by a step-up transformer, that is stepped up, and the current decreases proportionally because P transmitted = I transmitted V transmitted ⋅ The lower current I transmitted in the transmission wires reduces the Joule losses, which is heating of the wire due to a current flow. This heating is caused by the small, but nonzero, resistance R wire of the transmission wires. The power lost to the environment through this heat is P lost = I transmitted 2 R wire , which is proportional to the current squared in the transmission wire. This is why the transmitted current I transmitted must be as small as possible and, consequently, the voltage must be large to transmit the power P transmitted ⋅ Voltages ranging from 120 to 700 kV are used for transmitting power over long distances. The voltage is stepped up at the exit of the power station by a step-up transformer, as shown in . Transformers change voltages at several points in a power distribution system. Electric power is usually generated at greater than 10 kV, and transmitted long distances at voltages ranging from 120 kV to 700 kV to limit energy losses. Local power distribution to neighborhoods or industries goes through a substation and is sent short distances at voltages ranging from 5 to 13 kV. This is reduced to 120, 240, or 480 V for safety at the individual user site. Once the power has arrived at a population or industrial center, the voltage is stepped down at a substation to between 5 and 30 kV. Finally, at individual homes or businesses, the power is stepped down again to 120, 240, or 480 V. Each step-up and step-down transformation is done with a transformer designed based on Faradays law of induction. We’ve come a long way since Queen Elizabeth asked Faraday what possible use could be made of electricity. Check Your Understanding What should be the ratio of the number of output coils to the number of input coil in a step-up transformer to increase the voltage fivefold? The ratio is five times. The ratio is 10 times. The ratio is 15 times. The ratio is 20 times. Section Summary Electric motors contain wire loops in a magnetic field. Current is passed through the wire loops, which forces them to rotate in the magnetic field. The current is reversed every half rotation so that the torque on the loop is always in the same direction. Electric generators contain wire loops in a magnetic field. An external agent provides mechanical energy to force the loops to rotate in the magnetic field, which produces an AC voltage that drives an AC current through the loops. Transformers contain a ring made of magnetic material and, on opposite sides of the ring, two windings of wire wrap around the ring. A changing current in one wire winding creates a changing magnetic field, which is trapped in the ring and thus goes through the second winding and induces an emf in the second winding. The voltage in the second winding is proportional to the ratio of the number of loops in each winding. Transformers are used to step up and step down the voltage for power transmission. Over long distances, electric power is transmitted at high voltage to minimize the current and thereby minimize the Joule losses due to resistive heating. Concept Items What is a voltage transformer?

Torque remains the same. Torque is doubled. Torque is quadrupled. Torque is halved. Test Prep Short Answer A laminated-coil transformer has a wire coiled 12 times around one of its sides. How many coils should you wrap around the opposite side to get a voltage output that is one half of the input voltage? Explain. six output coils because the ratio of output to input voltage is the same as the ratio of number of output coils to input coils 12 output coils because the ratio of output to input voltage is the same as the ratio of number of output coils to input coils 24 output coils because the ratio of output to input voltage is half the ratio of the number of output coils to input coils 36 output coils because the ratio of output to input voltage is three times the ratio of the number of output coils to input coils Explain why long-distance electrical power lines are designed to carry very high voltages. Ptransmitted = Itransmitted>2 Rwire and Plost = Itransmitted Vtransmitted, so V must be low to make the current transmitted as high as possible. Ptransmitted = Itransmitted>2 Rwire and Plost = Ilost Vlost, so V must be low to make the current transmitted as high as possible. Ptransmitted = Itransmitted>2 Rwire and Plost = Itransmitted Vtransmitted, so V must be high to make the current transmitted as low as possible Plost = Itransmitted2 Rwire and Ptransmitted = Itransmitted Vtransmitted, so V must be high to make the current transmitted as low as possible. Performance Task Your family takes a trip to Cuba, and rents an old car to drive into the countryside to see the sights. Unfortunately, the next morning you find yourself deep in the countryside and the car won’t start because the battery is too weak. Wanting to jump-start the car, you open the hood and find that you can’t tell which battery terminal is positive and which is negative. However, you do have a bar magnet with the north and south poles labeled and you manage to find a short wire. How do you use these to determine which terminal is which? For starters, how do you determine the direction of a magnetic field around a current-carrying wire? And in which direction will the force be on another magnet placed in this field? Do you need to worry about the sign of the mobile charge carriers in the wire? Teacher Support This experiment can be done by using typical AAA batteries or similar batteries, a short length of flexible wire, and normal magnets, for example a good refrigerator magnet. The magnet should have the north and south poles labeled. Place the magnet near the wire so that the magnetic field of the magnet will be roughly parallel or antiparallel to the magnet field created by current in the wire. Upon briefly connecting the wire across the terminals of the battery, the wire will be attracted or repelled, respectively, from the magnet. By using the right-hand rule, you can determine in which the direction the current is flowing in the wire and thereby determine the polarity of the battery. Test Prep Extended Response Your friend tells you that power lines must carry a maximum current because P = I2R, where R is the resistance of the transmission line. What do you tell her? Ptransmitted = Itransmitted2Rwire and Plost = Itransmitted Vtransmitted, so I must be high to reduce power lost due to transmission. Plost = Itransmitted2Rwire and Plost = Itransmitted Vtransmitted, so I must be high to reduce power lost due to transmission. Ptransmitted = Itransmitted2Rwire and Plost = Itransmitted Vtransmitted, so I must be low to reduce power lost due to transmission. Plost = Itransmitted2Rwire and Plost = Itransmitted Vtransmitted, so I must be low to reduce power lost due to transmission. electric motor device that transforms electrical energy into mechanical energy generator device that transforms mechanical energy into electrical energy transformer device that transforms voltages from one value to another", "formulas": [], "subsections": [], "extraction_stats": {"chapters_found": 23, "text_length": 1895072, "modules_processed": 98}, "content_hash": "93f89c3db3e2c9ab6f8204866c429cdc", "section_index": 2, "total_sections": 4}

Section Key Terms emf induction magnetic flux Changing Magnetic Fields In the preceding section, we learned that a current creates a magnetic field. If nature is symmetrical, then perhaps a magnetic field can create a current. In 1831, some 12 years after the discovery that an electric current generates a magnetic field, English scientist Michael Faraday (1791–1862) and American scientist Joseph Henry (1797–1878) independently demonstrated that magnetic fields can produce currents. The basic process of generating currents with magnetic fields is called induction; this process is also called magnetic induction to distinguish it from charging by induction, which uses the electrostatic Coulomb force. When Faraday discovered what is now called Faraday’s law of induction, Queen Victoria asked him what possible use was electricity. “Madam,” he replied, “What good is a baby?” Today, currents induced by magnetic fields are essential to our technological society. The electric generator—found in everything from automobiles to bicycles to nuclear power plants—uses magnetism to generate electric current. Other devices that use magnetism to induce currents include pickup coils in electric guitars, transformers of every size, certain microphones, airport security gates, and damping mechanisms on sensitive chemical balances. One experiment Faraday did to demonstrate magnetic induction was to move a bar magnet through a wire coil and measure the resulting electric current through the wire. A schematic of this experiment is shown in . He found that current is induced only when the magnet moves with respect to the coil. When the magnet is motionless with respect to the coil, no current is induced in the coil, as in . In addition, moving the magnet in the opposite direction (compare with ) or reversing the poles of the magnet (compare with ) results in a current in the opposite direction. Movement of a magnet relative to a coil produces electric currents as shown. The same currents are produced if the coil is moved relative to the magnet. The greater the speed, the greater the magnitude of the current, and the current is zero when there is no motion. The current produced by moving the magnet upward is in the opposite direction as the current produced by moving the magnet downward. Faraday’s Law Try this simulation to see how moving a magnet creates a current in a circuit. A light bulb lights up to show when current is flowing, and a voltmeter shows the voltage drop across the light bulb. Try moving the magnet through a four-turn coil and through a two-turn coil. For the same magnet speed, which coil produces a higher voltage? Induced Electromotive ForceIf a current is induced in the coil, Faraday reasoned that there must be what he called an electromotive force pushing the charges through the coil. This interpretation turned out to be incorrect; instead, the external source doing the work of moving the magnet adds energy to the charges in the coil. The energy added per unit charge has units of volts, so the electromotive force is actually a potential. Unfortunately, the name electromotive force stuck and with it the potential for confusing it with a real force. For this reason, we avoid the term electromotive force and just use the abbreviation emf, which has the mathematical symbol ε . The emf may be defined as the rate at which energy is drawn from a source per unit current flowing through a circuit. Thus, emf is the energy per unit charge added by a source, which contrasts with voltage, which is the energy per unit charge released as the charges flow through a circuit. To understand why an emf is generated in a coil due to a moving magnet, consider , which shows a bar magnet moving downward with respect to a wire loop. Initially, seven magnetic field lines are going through the loop (see left-hand image). Because the magnet is moving away from the coil, only five magnetic field lines are going through the loop after a short time Δt (see right-hand image). Thus, when a change occurs in the number of magnetic field lines going through the area defined by the wire loop, an emf is induced in the wire loop. Experiments such as this show that the induced emf is proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic field. Mathematically, we express this as ε∝ ΔB Δt , where ΔB is the change in the magnitude in the magnetic field during time Δt and A is the area of the loop. The bar magnet moves downward with respect to the wire loop, so that the number of magnetic field lines going through the loop decreases with time. This causes an emf to be induced in the loop, creating an electric current. Note that magnetic field lines that lie in the plane of the wire loop do not actually pass through the loop, as shown by the left-most loop in . In this figure, the arrow coming out of the loop is a vector whose magnitude is the area of the loop and whose direction is perpendicular to the plane of the loop. In , as the loop is rotated from θ=90° to θ=0°, the contribution of the magnetic field lines to the emf increases. Thus, what is important in generating an emf in the wire loop is the component of the magnetic field that is perpendicular to the plane of the loop, which is Bcosθ. This is analogous to a sail in the wind. Think of the conducting loop as the sail and the magnetic field as the wind. To maximize the force of the wind on the sail, the sail is oriented so that its surface vector points in the same direction as the winds, as in the right-most loop in . When the sail is aligned so that its surface vector is perpendicular to the wind, as in the left-most loop in , then the wind exerts no force on the sail. Thus, taking into account the angle of the magnetic field with respect to the area, the proportionality ε∝ ΔB/ Δt becomes ε∝ ΔB cosθ Δt . The magnetic field lies in the plane of the left-most loop, so it cannot generate an emf in this case. When the loop is rotated so that the angle of the magnetic field with the vector perpendicular to the area of the loop increases to 90° (see right-most loop), the magnetic field contributes maximally to the emf in the loop. The dots show where the magnetic field lines intersect the plane defined by the loop. Another way to reduce the number of magnetic field lines that go through the conducting loop in is not to move the magnet but to make the loop smaller. Experiments show that changing the area of a conducting loop in a stable magnetic field induces an emf in the loop. Thus, the emf produced in a conducting loop is proportional to the rate of change of the product of the perpendicular magnetic field and the loop area ε∝ Δ[ ( Bcosθ )A ] Δt , where Bcosθ is the perpendicular magnetic field and A is the area of the loop. The product BAcosθ is very important. It is proportional to the number of magnetic field lines that pass perpendicularly through a surface of area A. Going back to our sail analogy, it would be proportional to the force of the wind on the sail. It is called the magnetic flux and is represented by Φ . Φ=BAcosθ The unit of magnetic flux is the weber (Wb), which is magnetic field per unit area, or T/m2. The weber is also a volt second (Vs). The induced emf is in fact proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic flux through a conducting loop. ε∝ ΔΦ Δt Finally, for a coil made from N loops, the emf is N times stronger than for a single loop. Thus, the emf induced by a changing magnetic field in a coil of N loops is ε∝N ΔBcosθ Δt A. The last question to answer before we can change the proportionality into an equation is “In what direction does the current flow?” The Russian scientist Heinrich Lenz (1804–1865) explained that the current flows in the direction that creates a magnetic field that tries to keep the flux constant in the loop. For example, consider again . The motion of the bar magnet causes the number of upward-pointing magnetic field lines that go through the loop to decrease. Therefore, an emf is generated in the loop that drives a current in the direction that creates more upward-pointing magnetic field lines. By using the right-hand rule, we see that this current must flow in the direction shown in the figure. To express the fact that the induced emf acts to counter the change in the magnetic flux through a wire loop, a minus sign is introduced into the proportionality ε∝ ΔΦ/ Δt. , which gives Faraday’s law of induction. ε=−N ΔΦ Δt Lenz’s law is very important. To better understand it, consider , which shows a magnet moving with respect to a wire coil and the direction of the resulting current in the coil. In the top row, the north pole of the magnet approaches the coil, so the magnetic field lines from the magnet point toward the coil. Thus, the magnetic field B → mag = B mag ( x ^ ) pointing to the right increases in the coil. According to Lenz’s law, the emf produced in the coil will drive a current in the direction that creates a magnetic field B → coil = B coil ( − x ^ ) inside the coil pointing to the left. This will counter the increase in magnetic flux pointing to the right. To see which way the current must flow, point your right thumb in the desired direction of the magnetic field B → coil, and the current will flow in the direction indicated by curling your right fingers. This is shown by the image of the right hand in the top row of . Thus, the current must flow in the direction shown in Figure 4(a).In Figure 4(b), the direction in which the magnet moves is reversed. In the coil, the right-pointing magnetic field B → mag due to the moving magnet decreases. Lenz’s law says that, to counter this decrease, the emf will drive a current that creates an additional right-pointing magnetic field B → coil in the coil. Again, point your right thumb in the desired direction of the magnetic field, and the current will flow in the direction indicate by curling your right fingers (Figure 4(b)).Finally, in Figure 4(c), the magnet is reversed so that the south pole is nearest the coil. Now the magnetic field B → mag points toward the magnet instead of toward the coil. As the magnet approaches the coil, it causes the left-pointing magnetic field in the coil to increase. Lenz’s law tells us that the emf induced in the coil will drive a current in the direction that creates a magnetic field pointing to the right. This will counter the increasing magnetic flux pointing to the left due to the magnet. Using the right-hand rule again, as indicated in the figure, shows that the current must flow in the direction shown in Figure 4(c). Lenz’s law tells us that the magnetically induced emf will drive a current that resists the change in the magnetic flux through a circuit. This is shown in panels (a)–(c) for various magnet orientations and velocities. The right hands at right show how to apply the right-hand rule to find in which direction the induced current flows around the coil. Faraday’s Electromagnetic Lab This simulation proposes several activities. For now, click on the tab Pickup Coil, which presents a bar magnet that you can move through a coil. As you do so, you can see the electrons move in the coil and a light bulb will light up or a voltmeter will indicate the voltage across a resistor. Note that the voltmeter allows you to see the sign of the voltage as you move the magnet about. You can also leave the bar magnet at rest and move the coil, although it is more difficult to observe the results. Induced Current in a Wire This video explains how a current can be induced in a straight wire by moving it through a magnetic field. The lecturer uses the cross product, which a type of vector multiplication. Don’t worry if you are not familiar with this, it basically combines the right-hand rule for determining the force on the charges in the wire with the equation F=qvBsinθ . What emf is produced across a straight wire 0.50 m long moving at a velocity of (1.5 m/s) x ^ through a uniform magnetic field (0.30 T)ẑ? The wire lies in the ŷ-direction. Also, which end of the wire is at the higher potential—let the lower end of the wire be at y = 0 and the upper end at y = 0.5 m)? 0.15 V and the lower end of the wire will be at higher potential 0.15 V and the upper end of the wire will be at higher potential 0.075 V and the lower end of the wire will be at higher potential 0.075 V and the upper end of the wire will be at higher potential EMF Induced in Conducing Coil by Moving Magnet Imagine a magnetic field goes through a coil in the direction indicated in . The coil diameter is 2.0 cm. If the magnetic field goes from 0.020 to 0.010 T in 34 s, what is the direction and magnitude of the induced current? Assume the coil has a resistance of 0.1 Ω. A coil through which passes a magnetic field B. Strategy Use the equation ε=−N ΔΦ/ Δt to find the induced emf in the coil, where Δt=34s . Counting the number of loops in the solenoid, we find it has 16 loops, so N=16 . Use the equation Φ=BAcosθ to calculate the magnetic flux Φ=BAcosθ=Bπ ( d 2 ) 2 , where d is the diameter of the solenoid and we have used cos0°=1 . Because the area of the solenoid does not vary, the change in the magnetic of the flux through the solenoid is ΔΦ=ΔBπ ( d 2 ) 2 . Once we find the emf, we can use Ohm’s law, ε=IR , to find the current.Finally, Lenz’s law tells us that the current should produce a magnetic field that acts to oppose the decrease in the applied magnetic field. Thus, the current should produce a magnetic field to the right. Solution Combining equations ε=−N ΔΦ/ Δt and Φ=BAcosθ gives ε=−N ΔΦ Δt =−N ΔBπ d 2 4Δt . Solving Ohm’s law for the current and using this result gives I = ε R =−N ΔBπ d 2 4RΔt = −16 ( −0.010T )π ( 0.020m ) 2 4( 0.10Ω )( 34s ) = 15μA . Lenz’s law tells us that the current must produce a magnetic field to the right. Thus, we point our right thumb to the right and curl our right fingers around the solenoid. The current must flow in the direction in which our fingers are pointing, so it enters at the left end of the solenoid and exits at the right end. Discussion Let’s see if the minus sign makes sense in Faraday’s law of induction. Define the direction of the magnetic field to be the positive direction. This means the change in the magnetic field is negative, as we found above. The minus sign in Faraday’s law of induction negates the negative change in the magnetic field, leaving us with a positive current. Therefore, the current must flow in the direction of the magnetic field, which is what we found. Now try defining the positive direction to be the direction opposite that of the magnetic field, that is positive is to the left in . In this case, you will find a negative current. But since the positive direction is to the left, a negative current must flow to the right, which again agrees with what we found by using Lenz’s law. Magnetic Induction due to Changing Circuit Size The circuit shown in consists of a U-shaped wire with a resistor and with the ends connected by a sliding conducting rod. The magnetic field filling the area enclosed by the circuit is constant at 0.01 T. If the rod is pulled to the right at speed v=0.50m/s, what current is induced in the circuit and in what direction does the current flow? A slider circuit. The magnetic field is constant and the rod is pulled to the right at speed v. The changing area enclosed by the circuit induces an emf in the circuit. Strategy We again use Faraday’s law of induction, ε=−N ΔΦ Δt , although this time the magnetic field is constant and the area enclosed by the circuit changes. The circuit contains a single loop, so N=1 . The rate of change of the area is ΔA Δt =vℓ . Thus the rate of change of the magnetic flux is ΔΦ Δt = Δ( BAcosθ ) Δt =B ΔA Δt =Bvℓ , where we have used the fact that the angle θ between the area vector and the magnetic field is 0°. Once we know the emf, we can find the current by using Ohm’s law. To find the direction of the current, we apply Lenz’s law. Solution Faraday’s law of induction gives ε=−N ΔΦ Δt =−Bvℓ . Solving Ohm’s law for the current and using the previous result for emf gives I= ε R = −Bvℓ R = −( 0.010T )( 0.50m/s )( 0.10m ) 20Ω =25μA . As the rod slides to the right, the magnetic flux passing through the circuit increases. Lenz’s law tells us that the current induced will create a magnetic field that will counter this increase. Thus, the magnetic field created by the induced current must be into the page. Curling your right-hand fingers around the loop in the clockwise direction makes your right thumb point into the page, which is the desired direction of the magnetic field. Thus, the current must flow in the clockwise direction around the circuit. Discussion Is energy conserved in this circuit? An external agent must pull on the rod with sufficient force to just balance the force on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field—recall that F=IℓBsinθ . The rate at which this force does work on the rod should be balanced by the rate at which the circuit dissipates power. Using F=IℓBsinθ , the force required to pull the wire at a constant speed v is F pull =IℓBsinθ=IℓB , where we used the fact that the angle θ between the current and the magnetic field is 90° . Inserting our expression above for the current into this equation gives F pull =IℓB=− Bvℓ R ( ℓB )=− B 2 v ℓ 2 R . The power contributed by the agent pulling the rod is F pull v, or P pull = F pull v=− B 2 v 2 ℓ 2 R . The power dissipated by the circuit is P dissipated = I 2 R= ( −Bvℓ R ) 2 R= B 2 v 2 ℓ 2 R . We thus see that P pull + P dissipated =0 , which means that power is conserved in the system consisting of the circuit and the agent that pulls the rod. Thus, energy is conserved in this system. Practice Problems The magnetic flux through a single wire loop changes from 3.5 Wb to 1.5 Wb in 2.0 s. What emf is induced in the loop? –2.0 V –1.0 V +1.0 V +2.0 V What is the emf for a 10-turn coil through which the flux changes at 10 Wb/s? –100 V –10 V +10 V +100 V Check Your Understanding Section Summary Faraday’s law of induction states that a changing magnetic flux that occurs within an area enclosed by a conducting loop induces an electric current in the loop. Lenz’ law states that an induced current flows in the direction such that it opposes the change that induced it. Key Equations magnetic flux Φ=BAcosθ emf ε=−N ΔΦ Δt Concept Items Yes or no—Is an emf induced in the coil shown when it is stretched? If so, state why and give the direction of the induced current. No, because induced current does not depend upon the area of the coil. Yes, because area of the coil decreases; the direction of the induced current is counterclockwise. Yes, because area of the coil decreases; the direction of the induced current is clockwise. Yes, because the area of the coil does not change; the direction of the induced current is clockwise. Explain how magnetic flux can be zero when the magnetic field is not zero. If angle between magnetic field and area vector is 0°, then its sine is also zero, which means that there is zero flux. If angle between magnetic field and area vector is 45°, then its sine is also zero, which means that there is zero flux. If angle between magnetic field and area vector is 60°, then its cosine is also zero, which means that there is zero flux. If the angle between magnetic field and area vector is 90°, then its cosine is also zero, which means that there is zero flux. Critical Thinking To obtain power from the current in the wire of your vacuum cleaner, you place a loop of wire near it to obtain an induced emf. How do you place and orient the loop? A loop of wire should be placed nearest to the vacuum cleaner wire to maximize the magnetic flux through the loop. A loop of wire should be placed farthest to the vacuum cleaner wire to maximize the magnetic flux through the loop. A loop of wire should be placed perpendicular to the vacuum cleaner wire to maximize the magnetic flux through the loop. A loop of wire should be placed at angle greater than 90° to the vacuum cleaner wire to maximize the magnetic flux through the loop. A magneto is a device that creates a spark across a gap by creating a large voltage across the gap. To do this, the device spins a magnet very quickly in front of a wire coil, with the ends of the wires forming the gap. Explain how this creates a sufficiently large voltage to produce a spark. The electric field in the coil increases rapidly due to spinning of magnet which creates an emf in the coil that is proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic flux. The magnetic field in the coil changes rapidly due to spinning of magnet which creates an emf in the coil that is proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic flux.

Explain why or why not. No, because the net magnetic field passing through the loop is zero. No, because the net magnetic field passing through the loop is nonzero. Yes, because the net magnetic field passing through the loop is zero. Yes, because the net magnetic field line passing through the loop is nonzero.

Explain your reasoning. Magnets exert an attractive force, because magnetic field due to induced current is repulsed by the magnetic field of the magnets. Magnets exert an attractive force, because magnetic field due to induced current is attracted by the magnetic field of the magnets. Magnets exert a repulsive force, because magnetic field due to induced current is repulsed by the magnetic field of the magnets. Magnets exert a repulsive force, because magnetic field due to induced current is attracted by the magnetic field of the magnets.

(credit: modification of work by John Tenniel, Wikimedia Commons) Teacher Support Discuss with students what features of Alice in Wonderland were unusual compared to life as Alice typically knew it. Question whether an inherent logic still existed in Wonderland. These discussions should prepare students not only to anticipate the bizarre nature of quantum mechanics but also to look for its underlying structure. Ask students to review what concepts of physics they consider normal. Look for big ideas: the structure of matter, conservation of momentum and energy, and the like. Have the students consider earlier instances in the course of which these concepts have been challenged or expanded. A reminder of relativity of gravitational fields could remind them that simple concepts are often more than what they seem. At first glance, the quantum nature of light can be a strange and bewildering concept. Between light acting as discrete chunks, massless particles providing momenta, and fundamental particles behaving like waves, it may often seem like something out of Alice in Wonderland.For many, the study of this branch of physics can be as enthralling as Lewis Carroll’s classic novel. Recalling the works of legendary characters and brilliant scientists such as Einstein, Planck, and Compton, the study of light’s quantum nature will provide you an interesting tale of how a clever interpretation of some small details led to the most important discoveries of the past 150 years. From the electronics revolution of the twentieth century to our future progress in solar energy and space exploration, the quantum nature of light should yield a rabbit hole of curious consequence, within which lie some of the most fascinating truths of our time. Teacher Support Before students begin this chapter, it would be useful to review the following concepts: The wave nature of light—particularly the relationship between wavelength, frequency, and speed. The electromagnetic (EM) spectrum—review what separates ultraviolet from visible light and other portions of the EM spectrum. Review the various EM divisions in order of increasing frequency. The reflection and absorption of light upon reaching a new boundary. No need to discuss refraction or Snell’s Law, just a reminder that the energy will be reflected or transmitted.

Section Key Terms blackbody quantized quantum ultraviolet catastrophe Blackbodies Teacher Support Prior to beginning this section, it would be a good idea to review wave concepts including frequency, wavelength, and amplitude. Have students write down a list of equations or statements that relate to the three concepts. [BL][OL]Discuss what could be meant by the term blackbody. Why do some objects appear black? Furthermore, why do we see objects that are red as red? It is said that black is the absence of color, but what does that mean in terms of the light reflected into our eyes? [AL]Discuss what can happen to energy when it strikes a surface. Discuss how it can be reflected or transmitted. If a blackbody is perfectly black, what must be happening to all of the energy incident upon it? [EL]Reinforce that the term blackbody is nothing more than its name suggests—that is, a body that is perfectly black. Discuss what perfectly black means. Is a black piece of paper perfectly black? Our first story of curious significance begins with a T-shirt. You are likely aware that wearing a tight black T-shirt outside on a hot day provides a significantly less comfortable experience than wearing a white shirt. Black shirts, as well as all other black objects, will absorb and re-emit a significantly greater amount of radiation from the sun. This shirt is a good approximation of what is called a blackbody. Teacher Support Occasionally, texts refer to blackbody and perfect blackbody as two different concepts. It is likely best to refer to anything that is not a perfect blackbody as an approximation of a blackbody in order to avoid confusion. A perfect blackbody is one that absorbs and re-emits all radiated energy that is incident upon it. Imagine wearing a tight shirt that did this! This phenomenon is often modeled with quite a different scenario. Imagine carving a small hole in an oven that can be heated to very high temperatures. As the temperature of this container gets hotter and hotter, the radiation out of this dark hole would increase as well, re-emitting all energy provided it by the increased temperature. The hole may even begin to glow in different colors as the temperature is increased. Like a burner on your stove, the hole would glow red, then orange, then blue, as the temperature is increased. In time, the hole would continue to glow but the light would be invisible to our eyes. This container is a good model of a perfect blackbody. It is the analysis of blackbodies that led to one of the most consequential discoveries of the twentieth century. Take a moment to carefully examine . What relationships exist? What trends can you see? The more time you spend interpreting this figure, the closer you will be to understanding quantum physics! Graphs of blackbody radiation (from an ideal radiator) at three different radiator temperatures. The intensity or rate of radiation emission increases dramatically with temperature, and the peak of the spectrum shifts toward the visible and ultraviolet parts of the spectrum. The shape of the spectrum cannot be described with classical physics. Teacher Support It is important for students to make sense of before progressing further. Have students independently create a list of observations from the graph. When presenting their observations, press the students on the specifics of their observations. [BL]Discuss what variables are being graphed. Have them complete the statement: ________ is dependent upon ________. Discuss what is meant by intensity. What is the difference between being mad and intensely mad? [OL]Discuss what the peak of each graph refers to. Ask if the radiation intensity depends upon the wavelength of the radiation. How do they know this? What do the peaks on each graph mean? [AL]Discuss why there are three lines on the graph. Does it make sense that an increase in temperature would cause the line of the graph to be raised? Why does this make sense? A good challenging exercise would be to have the students re-graph the information in order to represent EM radiation intensity against frequency. When encountering a new graph, it is best to try to interpret the graph before you read about it. Doing this will make the following text more meaningful and will help to remind yourself of some of the key concepts within the section. Understanding Blackbody Graphs is a plot of radiation intensity against radiated wavelength. In other words, it shows how the intensity of radiated light changes when a blackbody is heated to a particular temperature. It may help to just follow the bottom-most red line labeled 3,000 K, red hot. The graph shows that when a blackbody acquires a temperature of 3,000 K, it radiates energy across the electromagnetic spectrum. However, the energy is most intensely emitted at a wavelength of approximately 1000 nm. This is in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. While a body at this temperature would appear red-hot to our eyes, it would truly appear ‘infrared-hot’ if we were able to see the entire spectrum. A few other important notes regarding : As temperature increases, the total amount of energy radiated increases. This is shown by examining the area underneath each line. Regardless of temperature, all red lines on the graph undergo a consistent pattern. While electromagnetic radiation is emitted throughout the spectrum, the intensity of this radiation peaks at one particular wavelength. As the temperature changes, the wavelength of greatest radiation intensity changes. At 4,000 K, the radiation is most intense in the yellow-green portion of the spectrum. At 6,000 K, the blackbody would radiate white hot, due to intense radiation throughout the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Remember that white light is the emission of all visible colors simultaneously. As the temperature increases, the frequency of light providing the greatest intensity increases as well. Recall the equation v=fλ. Because the speed of light is constant, frequency and wavelength are inversely related. This is verified by the leftward movement of the three red lines as temperature is increased. Teacher Support Discuss the bullet points above. Why does an increase in temperature result in an increase in the total amount of energy radiated? Do you have personal experience with the relationship described in bullet point #3? Students may not have answers as to the causal factors for some of the observations in the above bullet points. Remind them that this is okay as these why questions were the big questions being asked by physicists at the turn of the twentieth century! [BL][OL]Do you have personal evidence to show that as temperature increases the energy radiated increases as well? [AL]Remind students that temperature is just a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles in a gas. Does this definition support bullet point #1? While in science it is important to categorize observations, theorizing as to why the observations exist is crucial to scientific advancement. Why doesn’t a blackbody emit radiation evenly across all wavelengths? Why does the temperature of the body change the peak wavelength that is radiated? Why does an increase in temperature cause the peak wavelength emitted to decrease? It is questions like these that drove significant research at the turn of the twentieth century. And within the context of these questions, Max Planck discovered something of tremendous importance. Planck’s Revolution Teacher Support Planck’s revolution is very much the story of the scientific method—reconciling disconnects between theory and experimental results. Encourage the students to think of other events—either historical or within their own lives—in which a predominant theory was shown to be incorrect when confronted with overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Possible examples include the geocentric model, the ether, or the four elements. The prevailing theory at the time of Max Planck’s discovery was that intensity and frequency were related by the equation I= 2kT λ 2 . This equation, derived from classical physics and using wave phenomena, infers that as wavelength increases, the intensity of energy provided will decrease with an inverse-squared relationship. This relationship is graphed in and shows a troubling trend. For starters, it should be apparent that the graph from this equation does not match the blackbody graphs found experimentally. Additionally, it shows that for an object of any temperature, there should be an infinite amount of energy quickly emitted in the shortest wavelengths. When theory and experimental results clash, it is important to re-evaluate both models. The disconnect between theory and reality was termed the ultraviolet catastrophe. The graph above shows the true spectral measurements by a blackbody against those predicted by the classical theory at the time. The discord between the predicted classical theory line and the actual results is known as the ultraviolet catastrophe. Due to concerns over the ultraviolet catastrophe, Max Planck began to question whether another factor impacted the relationship between intensity and wavelength. This factor, he posited, should affect the probability that short wavelength light would be emitted. Should this factor reduce the probability of short wavelength light, it would cause the radiance curve to not progress infinitely as in the classical theory, but would instead cause the curve to precipitate back downward as is shown in the 5,000 K, 4,000 K, and 3,000 K temperature lines of the graph in . Planck noted that this factor, whatever it may be, must also be dependent on temperature, as the intensity decreases at lower and lower wavelengths as the temperature increases. The determination of this probability factor was a groundbreaking discovery in physics, yielding insight not just into light but also into energy and matter itself. It would be the basis for Planck’s 1918 Nobel Prize in Physics and would result in the transition of physics from classical to modern understanding. In an attempt to determine the cause of the probability factor, Max Planck constructed a new theory. This theory, which created the branch of physics called quantum mechanics, speculated that the energy radiated by the blackbody could exist only in specific numerical, or quantum, states. This theory is described by the equation E=nhf, where n is any nonnegative integer (0, 1, 2, 3, …) and h is Planck’s constant, given by h=6.626× 10 −34 J⋅s, and f is frequency.Through this equation, Planck’s probability factor can be more clearly understood. Each frequency of light provides a specific quantized amount of energy. Low frequency light, associated with longer wavelengths would provide a smaller amount of energy, while high frequency light, associated with shorter wavelengths, would provide a larger amount of energy. For specified temperatures with specific total energies, it makes sense that more low frequency light would be radiated than high frequency light. To a degree, the relationship is like pouring coins through a funnel. More of the smaller pennies would be able to pass through the funnel than the larger quarters. In other words, because the value of the coin is somewhat related to the size of the coin, the probability of a quarter passing through the funnel is reduced! Furthermore, an increase in temperature would signify the presence of higher energy. As a result, the greater amount of total blackbody energy would allow for more of the high frequency, short wavelength, energies to be radiated. This permits the peak of the blackbody curve to drift leftward as the temperature increases, as it does from the 3,000 K to 4,000 K to 5,000 K values. Furthering our coin analogy, consider a wider funnel. This funnel would permit more quarters to pass through and allow for a reduction in concern about the probability factor. In summary, it is the interplay between the predicted classical model and the quantum probability that creates the curve depicted in . Just as quarters have a higher currency denomination than pennies, higher frequencies come with larger amounts of energy. However, just as the probability of a quarter passing through a fixed diameter funnel is reduced, so is the probability of a high frequency light existing in a fixed temperature object. As is often the case in physics, it is the balancing of multiple incredible ideas that finally allows for better understanding. Quantization Teacher Support [EL]Quantum is related to the word quantity, a measure of the amount of something. Discuss why the term quantum would be useful in this context. [BL, OL, AL]Quantum vs. continuous states is well described when considering clocks. A digital clock represents quantum states—it reads 11:14 a.m., then 11:15 a.m. An analog clock with a continually gliding second hand is a good representation of continuous states—it does not appear to pause at any one instant. What would you consider an analog clock that ticks each second? What would you consider a grandfather clock? It may be helpful at this point to further consider the idea of quantum states. Atoms, molecules, and fundamental electron and proton charges are all examples of physical entities that are quantized—that is, they appear only in certain discrete values and do not have every conceivable value. On the macroscopic scale, this is not a revolutionary concept. A standing wave on a string allows only particular harmonics described by integers. Going up and down a hill using discrete stair steps causes your potential energy to take on discrete values as you move from step to step. Furthermore, we cannot have a fraction of an atom, or part of an electron’s charge, or 14.33 cents. Rather, everything is built of integral multiples of these substructures. That said, to discover quantum states within a phenomenon that science had always considered continuous would certainly be surprising. When Max Planck was able to use quantization to correctly describe the experimentally known shape of the blackbody spectrum, it was the first indication that energy was quantized on a small scale as well. This discovery earned Planck the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918 and was such a revolutionary departure from classical physics that Planck himself was reluctant to accept his own idea. The general acceptance of Planck’s energy quantization was greatly enhanced by Einstein’s explanation of the photoelectric effect (discussed in the next section), which took energy quantization a step further. The German physicist Max Planck had a major influence on the early development of quantum mechanics, being the first to recognize that energy is sometimes quantized. Planck also made important contributions to special relativity and classical physics.

Assuming that 10 percent of a 100-W light bulb’s energy output is in the visible range (typical for incandescent bulbs) with an average wavelength of 580 nm, calculate the number of visible photons emitted per second. Strategy The number of visible photons per second is directly related to the amount of energy emitted each second, also known as the bulb’s power. By determining the bulb’s power, the energy emitted each second can be found. Since the power is given in watts, which is joules per second, the energy will be in joules. By comparing this to the amount of energy associated with each photon, the number of photons emitted each second can be determined. Solution The power in visible light production is 10.0 percent of 100 W, or 10.0 J/s. The energy of the average visible photon is found by substituting the given average wavelength into the formula E=nhf= nhc λ . By rearranging the above formula to determine energy per photon, this produces E/n= (6.63× 10 −34 J⋅s)(3.00× 10 8 m/s) 580× 10 −9 m =3.43× 10 −19 J/photon. The number of visible photons per second is thus photons sec = 10.0 J/s 3.43× 10 −19 J/photon =2.92× 10 19 photons/s. Discussion This incredible number of photons per second is verification that individual photons are insignificant in ordinary human experience. However, it is also a verification of our everyday experience—on the macroscopic scale, photons are so small that quantization becomes essentially continuous. How does Photon Energy Change with Various Portions of the EM Spectrum? Refer to the Graphs of Blackbody Radiation shown in the first figure in this section. Compare the energy necessary to radiate one photon of infrared light and one photon of visible light.Strategy To determine the energy radiated, it is necessary to use the equation E=nhf. It is also necessary to find a representative frequency for infrared light and visible light. Solution According to the first figure in this section, one representative wavelength for infrared light is 2000 nm (2.000 × 10-6 m). The associated frequency of an infrared light is f= c λ = 3.00× 10 8 m/s 2.000× 10 −6 m =1.50× 10 14 Hz. Using the equation E=nhf , the energy associated with one photon of representative infrared light is E n =h⋅f=( 6.63× 10 −34 J⋅s )( 1.50× 10 14 Hz )=9.95× 10 −20 J photon . The same process above can be used to determine the energy associated with one photon of representative visible light. According to the first figure in this section, one representative wavelength for visible light is 500 nm. f= c λ = 3.00× 10 8 m/s 5.00× 10 −7 m =6.00× 10 14 Hz. E n =h⋅f=( 6.63× 10 −34 J⋅s )( 6.00× 10 14 Hz )=3.98× 10 −19 J photon . Discussion This example verifies that as the wavelength of light decreases, the quantum energy increases. This explains why a fire burning with a blue flame is considered more dangerous than a fire with a red flame. Each photon of short-wavelength blue light emitted carries a greater amount of energy than a long-wavelength red light. This example also helps explain the differences in the 3,000 K, 4,000 K, and 6,000 K lines shown in the first figure in this section. As the temperature is increased, more energy is available for a greater number of short-wavelength photons to be emitted. Practice Problems An AM radio station broadcasts at a frequency of 1,530 kHz . What is the energy in Joules of a photon emitted from this station? 10.1 × 10-26 J 1.01 × 10-28 J 1.01 × 10-29 J 1.01 × 10-27 J A photon travels with energy of 1.0 eV. What type of EM radiation is this photon? visible radiation microwave radiation infrared radiation ultraviolet radiation Check Your Understanding Do reflective or absorptive surfaces more closely model a perfect blackbody? reflective surfaces absorptive surfaces Why do we not notice quantization of photons in everyday experience? because the size of each photon is very large because the mass of each photon is so small because the energy provided by photons is very large because the energy provided by photons is very small Section Summary A blackbody will radiate energy across all wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. Radiation of a blackbody will peak at a particular wavelength, dependent on the temperature of the blackbody. Analysis of blackbody radiation led to the field of quantum mechanics, which states that radiated energy can only exist in discrete quantum states. Key Equations quantum energy E=nhf Concept Items What aspect of the blackbody spectrum forced Planck to propose quantization of energy levels in atoms and molecules? Radiation occurs at a particular frequency that does not change with the energy supplied. Certain radiation occurs at a particular frequency that changes with the energy supplied. Maximum radiation would occur at a particular frequency that does not change with the energy supplied. Maximum radiation would occur at a particular frequency that changes with the energy supplied. Two lasers shine red light at 650 nm. One laser is twice as bright as the other. Explain this difference using photons and photon energy. The brighter laser emits twice the number of photons and more energy per photon. The brighter laser emits twice the number of photons and less energy per photon. Both lasers emit equal numbers of photons and equivalent amounts of energy per photon. The brighter laser emits twice the number of photons but both lasers emit equivalent amounts of energy per photon. Consider four stars in the night sky: red, yellow, orange, and blue. The photons of which star will carry the greatest amount of energy? blue orange red yellow A lightbulb is wired to a variable resistor. What will happen to the color spectrum emitted by the bulb as the resistance of the circuit is increased? The bulb will emit greener light. The bulb will emit bluer light. The bulb will emit more ultraviolet light. The bulb will emit redder light. Critical Thinking Why does the intensity shown in the blackbody radiation graph decrease after its peak frequency is achieved? Because after reaching the peak frequency, the photons created at a particular frequency are too many for energy intensity to continue to decrease. Because after reaching the peak frequency, the photons created at a particular frequency are too few for energy intensity to continue to decrease. Because after reaching the peak frequency, the photons created at a particular frequency are too many for energy intensity to continue to increase. Because after reaching the peak frequency, the photons created at a particular frequency are too few for energy intensity to continue to increase. Why is it assumed that a perfect absorber of light (like a blackbody) must also be a perfect emitter of light?

Section Key Terms electric eye photoelectric effect photoelectron photon The Photoelectric Effect Teacher Support [EL]Ask the students what they think the term photoelectric means. How does the term relate to its definition? When light strikes certain materials, it can eject electrons from them. This is called the photoelectric effect, meaning that light (photo) produces electricity. One common use of the photoelectric effect is in light meters, such as those that adjust the automatic iris in various types of cameras. Another use is in solar cells, as you probably have in your calculator or have seen on a rooftop or a roadside sign. These make use of the photoelectric effect to convert light into electricity for running different devices. Teacher Support [BL][OL]Discuss with students what may cause light to eject electrons from a material. Are there certain materials that are more susceptible to having electrons ejected? [AL]Ask students why a light meter would be useful in a camera. How could the number of electrons emitted from the light meter control the camera’s iris? Have students draw a diagram of the camera that may demonstrate this effect. The photoelectric effect can be observed by allowing light to fall on the metal plate in this evacuated tube. Electrons ejected by the light are collected on the collector wire and measured as a current. A retarding voltage between the collector wire and plate can then be adjusted so as to determine the energy of the ejected electrons. (credit: P. P. Urone) Revolutionary Properties of the Photoelectric Effect When Max Planck theorized that energy was quantized in a blackbody radiator, it is unlikely that he would have recognized just how revolutionary his idea was. Using tools similar to the light meter in , it would take a scientist of Albert Einstein’s stature to fully discover the implications of Max Planck’s radical concept. Through careful observations of the photoelectric effect, Albert Einstein realized that there were several characteristics that could be explained only if EM radiation is itself quantized. While these characteristics will be explained a bit later in this section, you can already begin to appreciate why Einstein’s idea is very important. It means that the apparently continuous stream of energy in an EM wave is actually not a continuous stream at all. In fact, the EM wave itself is actually composed of tiny quantum packets of energy called photons. In equation form, Einstein found the energy of a photon or photoelectron to be E=hf, where E is the energy of a photon of frequency f and h is Planck’s constant. A beam from a flashlight, which to this point had been considered a wave, instead could now be viewed as a series of photons, each providing a specific amount of energy see . Furthermore, the amount of energy within each individual photon is based upon its individual frequency, as dictated by E=hf. As a result, the total amount of energy provided by the beam could now be viewed as the sum of all frequency-dependent photon energies added together. An EM wave of frequency f is composed of photons, or individual quanta of EM radiation. The energy of each photon is E=hf, where h is Planck’s constant and f is the frequency of the EM radiation. Higher intensity means more photons per unit area per second. The flashlight emits large numbers of photons of many different frequencies, hence others have energy E ′ =h f ′ , and so on. Teacher Support It is important for students to be comfortable with the material to this point before moving forward. To ensure that they are, one task that you may have them do is to draw a few pictures similar to . Have the students draw photons leaving a low intensity flashlight vs. a high intensity flashlight, a high frequency flashlight vs. a low frequency flashlight, and a high wavelength flashlight vs. a low wavelength flashlight. These diagrams will help ensure the students understand fundamental concepts before moving to the difficult proofs that follow. Just as with Planck’s blackbody radiation, Einstein’s concept of the photon could take hold in the scientific community only if it could succeed where classical physics failed. The photoelectric effect would be a key to demonstrating Einstein’s brilliance. Consider the following five properties of the photoelectric effect. All of these properties are consistent with the idea that individual photons of EM radiation are absorbed by individual electrons in a material, with the electron gaining the photon’s energy. Some of these properties are inconsistent with the idea that EM radiation is a simple wave. For simplicity, let us consider what happens with monochromatic EM radiation in which all photons have the same energy hf. Incident radiation strikes a clean metal surface, ejecting multiple electrons from it. The manner in which the frequency and intensity of the incoming radiation affect the ejected electrons strongly suggests that electromagnetic radiation is quantized. This event, called the photoelectric effect, is strong evidence for the existence of photons. If we vary the frequency of the EM radiation falling on a clean metal surface, we find the following: For a given material, there is a threshold frequency f0 for the EM radiation below which no electrons are ejected, regardless of intensity. Using the photon model, the explanation for this is clear. Individual photons interact with individual electrons. Thus if the energy of an individual photon is too low to break an electron away, no electrons will be ejected. However, if EM radiation were a simple wave, sufficient energy could be obtained simply by increasing the intensity. Once EM radiation falls on a material, electrons are ejected without delay. As soon as an individual photon of sufficiently high frequency is absorbed by an individual electron, the electron is ejected. If the EM radiation were a simple wave, several minutes would be required for sufficient energy to be deposited at the metal surface in order to eject an electron. The number of electrons ejected per unit time is proportional to the intensity of the EM radiation and to no other characteristic. High-intensity EM radiation consists of large numbers of photons per unit area, with all photons having the same characteristic energy, hf. The increased number of photons per unit area results in an increased number of electrons per unit area ejected. If we vary the intensity of the EM radiation and measure the energy of ejected electrons, we find the following: The maximum kinetic energy of ejected electrons is independent of the intensity of the EM radiation. Instead, as noted in point 3 above, increased intensity results in more electrons of the same energy being ejected. If EM radiation were a simple wave, a higher intensity could transfer more energy, and higher-energy electrons would be ejected. The kinetic energy KE of an ejected electron equals the photon energy minus the binding energy BE of the electron in the specific material. An individual photon can give all of its energy to an electron. The photon’s energy is partly used to break the electron away from the material. The remainder goes into the ejected electron’s kinetic energy. In equation form, this is given by K E e =hf−BE, where K E e is the maximum kinetic energy of the ejected electron, hf is the photon’s energy, and BE is the binding energy of the electron to the particular material. The binding energy is also often called the work function of the material. This equation explains the properties of the photoelectric effect quantitatively and demonstrates that BE is the minimum amount of energy necessary to eject an electron. If the energy supplied is less than BE, the electron cannot be ejected. The binding energy can also be written as BE=h f 0 , where f 0 is the threshold frequency for the particular material. shows a graph of maximum K E e versus the frequency of incident EM radiation falling on a particular material. A graph of the kinetic energy of an ejected electron, KEe, versus the frequency of EM radiation impinging on a certain material. There is a threshold frequency below which no electrons are ejected, because the individual photon interacting with an individual electron has insufficient energy to break it away. Above the threshold energy, KEe increases linearly with f, consistent with KEe = hf − BE. The slope of this line is h, so the data can be used to determine Planck’s constant experimentally. Teacher Support Show students . What would be the kinetic energy of an electron if f is less than f0? What does this mean? Why would this be the case? These questions aim to help students internalize the concept of binding energy. The following five pieces of information can be difficult to follow without some organization. It may be useful to create a table of expected results of each of the five properties, with one column showing the classical wave model result and one column showing the modern photon model result. The table may look something like Table of Expected Results Classical Wave Model Modern Photon Model Threshold Frequency Electron Ejection Delay Intensity of EM Radiation Speed of Ejected Electrons Relationship between Kinetic Energy and Binding Energy Teacher Support It may be useful to complete the table above as a class. This material takes some time to interpret, so encourage students to move slowly. Once completed, your table may look like . Completed Table Classical Wave Model Modern Photon Model Threshold Frequency No threshold frequency. Increasing intensity is enough to provide the energy needed to free electrons. Threshold frequency exists, below which no electrons are emitted regardless of energy intensity. Electron Ejection Delay Electrons are ejected once enough energy has been supplied. Therefore, a delay may occur. No ejection delay exists. Intensity of EM Radiation Increased intensity will result in more electrons ejected, or electrons ejected with higher energy. Increased intensity will result in more electrons ejected. Speed of Ejected Electrons As intensity is increased, electrons may leave the surface at a greater ejection speed. An increase in intensity will not influence the ejection speed of the electron. Relationship between KE and BE No relationship specified, as BE is not linked to frequency. K E e =hf−BE Photoelectric Effect In this demonstration, see how light knocks electrons off a metal target, and recreate the experiment that spawned the field of quantum mechanics. In the circuit provided, what are the three ways to increase the current? increase the intensity, increase the wavelength, alter the target decrease the intensity, increase the wavelength, alter the target decrease the intensity, decrease the wavelength, alter the target increase the intensity, decrease the wavelength, alter the target Photon Energy and the Photoelectric Effect: A Violet Light (a) What is the energy in joules and electron volts of a photon of 420-nm violet light? (b) What is the maximum kinetic energy of electrons ejected from calcium by 420 nm violet light, given that the binding energy of electrons for calcium metal is 2.71 eV? Strategy To solve part (a), note that the energy of a photon is given by E=hf . For part (b), once the energy of the photon is calculated, it is a straightforward application of K E e =hf−BE to find the ejected electron’s maximum kinetic energy, since BE is given. Solution for (a) Photon energy is given by E=hf. Since we are given the wavelength rather than the frequency, we solve the familiar relationship c=fλ for the frequency, yielding f= c λ Combining these two equations gives the useful relationship E= hc λ . Now substituting known values yields E= (6.63× 10 −34 J⋅s)(3.00× 10 8 m/s) 4.20× 10 −7 m =4.74× 10 −19 J. Converting to eV, the energy of the photon is E=(4.74× 10 −19 J⋅s) 1eV 1.60× 10 −19 J =2.96eV. Solution for (b) Finding the kinetic energy of the ejected electron is now a simple application of the equation K E e =hf−BE . Substituting the photon energy and binding energy yields K E e =hf−BE=2.96eV−2.71eV=0.25eV. Discussion The energy of this 420 nm photon of violet light is a tiny fraction of a joule, and so it is no wonder that a single photon would be difficult for us to sense directly—humans are more attuned to energies on the order of joules. But looking at the energy in electron volts, we can see that this photon has enough energy to affect atoms and molecules. A DNA molecule can be broken with about 1 eV of energy, for example, and typical atomic and molecular energies are on the order of eV, so that the photon in this example could have biological effects, such as sunburn. The ejected electron has rather low energy, and it would not travel far, except in a vacuum. The electron would be stopped by a retarding potential of only 0.26 eV, a slightly larger KE than calculated above. In fact, if the photon wavelength were longer and its energy less than 2.71 eV, then the formula would give a negative kinetic energy, an impossibility. This simply means that the 420 nm photons with their 2.96 eV energy are not much above the frequency threshold. You can see for yourself that the threshold wavelength is 458 nm (blue light). This means that if calcium metal were used in a light meter, the meter would be insensitive to wavelengths longer than those of blue light. Such a light meter would be completely insensitive to red light, for example.

If you have watched streetlights turn on automatically in response to the setting sun, stopped elevator doors from closing simply by putting your hands between them, or turned on a water faucet by sliding your hands near it, you are familiar with the electric eye, a name given to a group of devices that use the photoelectric effect for detection. All these devices rely on photoconductive cells. These cells are activated when light is absorbed by a semi-conductive material, knocking off a free electron. When this happens, an electron void is left behind, which attracts a nearby electron. The movement of this electron, and the resultant chain of electron movements, produces a current. If electron ejection continues, further holes are created, thereby increasing the electrical conductivity of the cell. This current can turn switches on and off and activate various familiar mechanisms. One such mechanism takes place where you may not expect it. Next time you are at the movie theater, pay close attention to the sound coming out of the speakers. This sound is actually created using the photoelectric effect! The audiotape in the projector booth is a transparent piece of film of varying width. This film is fed between a photocell and a bright light produced by an exciter lamp. As the transparent portion of the film varies in width, the amount of light that strikes the photocell varies as well. As a result, the current in the photoconductive circuit changes with the width of the filmstrip. This changing current is converted to a changing frequency, which creates the soundtrack commonly heard in the theater. Solar Energy Physicist According to the U.S. Department of Energy, Earth receives enough sunlight each hour to power the entire globe for a year. While converting all of this energy is impossible, the job of the solar energy physicist is to explore and improve upon solar energy conversion technologies so that we may harness more of this abundant resource. The field of solar energy is not a new one. For over half a century, satellites and spacecraft have utilized photovoltaic cells to create current and power their operations. As time has gone on, scientists have worked to adapt this process so that it may be used in homes, businesses, and full-scale power stations using solar cells like the one shown in . A solar cell is an example of a photovoltaic cell. As light strikes the cell, the cell absorbs the energy of the photons. If this energy exceeds the binding energy of the electrons, then electrons will be forced to move in the cell, thereby producing a current. This current may be used for a variety of purposes. (credit: U.S. Department of Energy) Solar energy is converted to electrical energy in one of two manners: direct transfer through photovoltaic cells or thermal conversion through the use of a CSP, concentrating solar power, system. Unlike electric eyes, which trip a mechanism when current is lost, photovoltaic cells utilize semiconductors to directly transfer the electrons released through the photoelectric effect into a directed current. The energy from this current can then be converted for storage, or immediately used in an electric process. A CSP system is an indirect method of energy conversion. In this process, light from the Sun is channeled using parabolic mirrors. The light from these mirrors strikes a thermally conductive material, which then heats a pool of water. This water, in turn, is converted to steam, which turns a turbine and creates electricity. While indirect, this method has long been the traditional means of large-scale power generation. There are, of course, limitations to the efficacy of solar power. Cloud cover, nightfall, and incident angle strike at high altitudes are all factors that directly influence the amount of light energy available. Additionally, the creation of photovoltaic cells requires rare-earth minerals that can be difficult to obtain. However, the major role of a solar energy physicist is to find ways to improve the efficiency of the solar energy conversion process. Currently, this is done by experimenting with new semi conductive materials, by refining current energy transfer methods, and by determining new ways of incorporating solar structures into the current power grid. Additionally, many solar physicists are looking into ways to allow for increased solar use in impoverished, more remote locations. Because solar energy conversion does not require a connection to a large-scale power grid, research into thinner, more mobile materials will permit remote cultures to use solar cells to convert sunlight collected during the day into stored energy that can then be used at night. Regardless of the application, solar energy physicists are an important part of the future in responsible energy growth. While a doctoral degree is often necessary for advanced research applications, a bachelor's or master's degree in a related science or engineering field is typically enough to gain access into the industry. Computer skills are very important for energy modeling, including knowledge of CAD software for design purposes. In addition, the ability to collaborate and communicate with others is critical to becoming a solar energy physicist. What role does the photoelectric effect play in the research of a solar energy physicist? The understanding of photoelectric effect allows the physicist to understand the generation of light energy when using photovoltaic cells. The understanding of photoelectric effect allows the physicist to understand the generation of electrical energy when using photovoltaic cells.

Check Your Understanding True or false—Visible light is the only type of electromagnetic radiation that can cause the photoelectric effect. false true Which aspects of the photoelectric effect can only be explained using photons? aspects 1, 2, and 3 aspects 1, 2, and 4 aspects 1, 2, 4 and 5 aspects 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 True or false—A current is created in a photoconductive cell, even if only one electron is expelled from a photon strike. false true Section Summary The photoelectric effect is the process in which EM radiation ejects electrons from a material. Einstein proposed photons to be quanta of EM radiation having energy E=hf, where f is the frequency of the radiation. All EM radiation is composed of photons. As Einstein explained, all characteristics of the photoelectric effect are due to the interaction of individual photons with individual electrons. The maximum kinetic energy KEe of ejected electrons (photoelectrons) is given by K E e =hf−BE, where hf is the photon energy and BE is the binding energy (or work function) of the electron in the particular material. Key Equations energy of a photon E=hf maximum kinetic energy of a photoelectron K E e =hf−BE binding energy of an electron BE=h f O Concept Items True or false—The concept of a work function (or binding energy) is permissible under the classical wave model. false true Can a single microwave photon cause cell damage? No, there is not enough energy associated with a single microwave photon to result in cell damage. No, there is zero energy associated with a single microwave photon, so it does not result in cell damage. Yes, a single microwave photon causes cell damage because it does not have high energy. Yes, a single microwave photon causes cell damage because it has enough energy. Critical Thinking Light is projected onto a semi-conductive surface. If the intensity is held constant but the frequency of light is increased, what will happen? As frequency is increased, electrons will stop being ejected from the surface. As frequency is increased, electrons will begin to be ejected from the surface. As frequency is increased, it will have no effect on the electrons being ejected as the intensity is the same. As frequency is increased, the rate at which the electrons are being ejected will increase. Why is it important to consider what material to use when designing a light meter? Consider the worked example from Section 21-2 for assistance. A light meter should contain material that responds only to high frequency light. A light meter should contain material that responds to low frequency light. A light meter should contain material that has high binding energy. A light meter should contain a material that does not show any photoelectric effect. Why does overexposure to UV light often result in sunburn when overexposure to visible light does not? This is why you can get burnt even on a cloudy day. UV light carries less energy than visible light and can penetrate our body. UV light carries more energy than visible light, so it cannot break bonds at the cellular level. UV light carries more energy than visible light and can break bonds at the cellular level. UV light carries less energy than visible light and cannot penetrate the human body. If you pick up and shake a piece of metal that has electrons in it free to move as a current, no electrons fall out. Yet if you heat the metal, electrons can be boiled off. Explain both of these facts as they relate to the amount and distribution of energy involved with shaking the object as compared with heating it. Thermal energy is added to the metal at a much higher rate than energy added due to shaking. Thermal energy is added to the metal at a much lower rate than energy added due to shaking. If the thermal energy added is below the binding energy of the electrons, they may be boiled off. If the mechanical energy added is below the binding energy of the electrons, they may be boiled off.

Section Key Terms Compton effect particle-wave duality photon momentum Photon Momentum Teacher Support Have students read the section heading. Ask them whether photons demonstrate momentum. They should answer yes, based on the photoelectric effect. Ask them what equation they would use to calculate this momentum. Push them on the idea that the momentum equation relies on mass, while photons are massless particles. Do photons abide by the fundamental properties of physics? Can packets of electromagnetic energy possibly follow the same rules as a ping-pong ball or an electron? Although strange to consider, the answer to both questions is yes. Despite the odd nature of photons, scientists prior to Einstein had long suspected that the fundamental particle of electromagnetic radiation shared properties with our more macroscopic particles. This is no clearer than when considering the photoelectric effect, where photons knock electrons out of a substance. While it is strange to think of a massless particle exhibiting momentum, it is now a well-established fact within the scientific community. shows macroscopic evidence of photon momentum. The tails of the Hale-Bopp comet point away from the Sun, evidence that light has momentum. Dust emanating from the body of the comet forms this tail. Particles of dust are pushed away from the Sun by light reflecting from them. The blue, ionized gas tail is also produced by photons interacting with atoms in the comet material. (credit: Geoff Chester, U.S. Navy, via Wikimedia Commons) shows a comet with two prominent tails. Comet tails are composed of gases and dust evaporated from the body of the comet and ionized gas. What most people do not know about the tails is that they always point away from the Sun rather than trailing behind the comet. This can be seen in the diagram. Why would this be the case? The evidence indicates that the dust particles of the comet are forced away from the Sun when photons strike them. Evidently, photons carry momentum in the direction of their motion away from the Sun, and some of this momentum is transferred to dust particles in collisions. The blue tail is caused by the solar wind, a stream of plasma consisting primarily of protons and electrons evaporating from the corona of the Sun. Momentum, The Compton Effect, and Solar Sails Momentum is conserved in quantum mechanics, just as it is in relativity and classical physics. Some of the earliest direct experimental evidence of this came from the scattering of X-ray photons by electrons in substances, a phenomenon discovered by American physicist Arthur H. Compton (1892–1962). Around 1923, Compton observed that X-rays reflecting from materials had decreased energy and correctly interpreted this as being due to the scattering of the X-ray photons by electrons. This phenomenon could be handled as a collision between two particles—a photon and an electron at rest in the material. After careful observation, it was found that both energy and momentum were conserved in the collision. See . For the discovery of this conserved scattering, now known as the Compton effect, Arthur Compton was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1929. Shortly after the discovery of Compton scattering, the value of the photon momentum, p= h λ , was determined by Louis de Broglie. In this equation, called the de Broglie relation, h represents Planck’s constant and λ is the photon wavelength. The Compton effect is the name given to the scattering of a photon by an electron. Energy and momentum are conserved, resulting in a reduction of both for the scattered photon. Teacher Support [BL][OL]Can students think of an equivalent macroscopic event that models both momentum and energy? Discuss the difficulties in modeling this on the particle scale. [AL]Have the students determine what information would need to be measured in order to show that both quantum energy and momentum were conserved. Additionally, the students could create a set of data that would fulfill the energy and momentum conservation equations used in . We can see that photon momentum is small, since p=h/λ. and h is very small. It is for this reason that we do not ordinarily observe photon momentum. Our mirrors do not recoil when light reflects from them, except perhaps in cartoons. Compton saw the effects of photon momentum because he was observing X-rays, which have a small wavelength and a relatively large momentum, interacting with the lightest of particles, the electron. Electron and Photon Momentum Compared (a) Calculate the momentum of a visible photon that has a wavelength of 500 nm. (b) Find the velocity of an electron having the same momentum. (c) What is the energy of the electron, and how does it compare with the energy of the photon? Strategy Finding the photon momentum is a straightforward application of its definition: p=h/λ. If we find the photon momentum is small, we can assume that an electron with the same momentum will be nonrelativistic, making it easy to find its velocity and kinetic energy from the classical formulas. Solution for (a) Photon momentum is given by the de Broglie relation. p= h λ Entering the given photon wavelength yields p= 6.63× 10 −34 J⋅s 5.00× 10 −7 m =1.33× 10 −27 kg⋅m/s. Solution for (b) Since this momentum is indeed small, we will use the classical expression p=mv to find the velocity of an electron with this momentum. Solving for v and using the known value for the mass of an electron gives v= p m = 1.33× 10 −27 kg⋅m/s 9.11× 10 −31 kg =1,459.9m/s≈1,460 m/s. Solution for (c) The electron has kinetic energy, which is classically given by K E e = 1 2 m v 2 . Thus, K E e = 1 2 (9.11× 10 −3 1 kg)(1,456m/s) 2 =9.64× 10 −25 J. Converting this to eV by multiplying by ( 1 eV ) ( 1.602× 10 –19 J ) yields K E e =6.02× 10 −6 eV. The photon energy E is E= hc λ = ( 6.63× 10 −34 J⋅s )( 3.00× 10 8 m/s ) 5.00× 10 −7 m =3.98× 10 −19 J=2.48eV, which is about five orders of magnitude greater. Discussion Even in huge numbers, the total momentum that photons carry is small. An electron that carries the same momentum as a 500-nm photon will have a 1,460 m/s velocity, which is clearly nonrelativistic. This is borne out by the experimental observation that it takes far less energy to give an electron the same momentum as a photon. That said, for high-energy photons interacting with small masses, photon momentum may be significant. Even on a large scale, photon momentum can have an effect if there are enough of them and if there is nothing to prevent the slow recoil of matter. Comet tails are one example, but there are also proposals to build space sails that use huge low-mass mirrors (made of aluminized Mylar) to reflect sunlight. In the vacuum of space, the mirrors would gradually recoil and could actually accelerate spacecraft within the solar system. See the following figure. When determining energies in particle physics, it is more sensible to use the unit eV instead of Joules. Using eV will help you to recognize differences in magnitude more easily and will make calculations simpler. Also, eV is used by scientists to describe the binding energy of particles and their rest mass, so using eV will eliminate the need to convert energy quantities. Finally, eV is a convenient unit when linking electromagnetic forces to particle physics, as one eV is the amount energy given to an electron when placed in a field of 1-V potential difference.

(credit: NASA/MSFC/D, Wikimedia Commons) Traversing the Solar System using nothing but the Sun’s power has long been a fantasy of scientists and science fiction writers alike. Though physicists like Compton, Einstein, and Planck all provided evidence of light’s propulsive capacity, it is only recently that the technology has become available to truly put these visions into motion. In 2016, by sending a lightweight satellite into space, the LightSail-1 project is designed to do just that. A citizen-funded project headed by the Planetary Society, the 5.45-million-dollar LightSail-1 project is set to launch two crafts into orbit around the Earth. Each craft is equipped with a 32-square-meter solar sail prepared to unfurl once a rocket has launched it to an appropriate altitude. The sails are made of large mirrors, each a quarter of the thickness of a trash bag, which will receive an impulse from the Sun’s reflecting photons. Each time the Sun’s photon strikes the craft’s reflective surface and bounces off, it will provide a momentum to the sail much greater than if the photon were simply absorbed. Attached to three tiny satellites called CubeSats, whose combined volume is no larger than a loaf of bread, the received momentum from the Sun’s photons should be enough to record a substantial increase in orbital speed. The intent of the LightSail-1 mission is to prove that the technology behind photon momentum travel is sound and can be done cheaply. A test flight in May 2015 showed that the craft’s Mylar sails could unfurl on command. With another successful result in 2016, the Planetary Society will be planning future versions of the craft with the hopes of eventually achieving interplanetary satellite travel. Though a few centuries premature, Kepler’s fantastic vision may not be that far away. Particle-Wave Duality Teacher Support Prior to this section, have the students create a chart of observations with columns that show that light is like a wave and light is like a particle. Reinforce that light is simply fulfilling both models and that we do not have a perfect model to describe its properties. Light does not choose when to be like a particle and when to be like a wave. We have long known that EM radiation is like a wave, capable of interference and diffraction. We now see that light can also be modeled as particles—massless photons of discrete energy and momentum. We call this twofold nature the particle-wave duality, meaning that EM radiation has properties of both particles and waves. This may seem contradictory, since we ordinarily deal with large objects that never act like both waves and particles. An ocean wave, for example, looks nothing like a grain of sand. However, this so-called duality is simply a term for properties of the photon analogous to phenomena we can observe directly, on a macroscopic scale. See . If this term seems strange, it is because we do not ordinarily observe details on the quantum level directly, and our observations yield either particle-like or wave-like properties, but never both simultaneously. (a) The interference pattern for light through a double slit is a wave property understood by analogy to water waves. (b) The properties of photons having quantized energy and momentum and acting as a concentrated unit are understood by analogy to macroscopic particles. Since we have a particle-wave duality for photons, and since we have seen connections between photons and matter in that both have momentum, it is reasonable to ask whether there is a particle-wave duality for matter as well. If the EM radiation we once thought to be a pure wave has particle properties, is it possible that matter has wave properties? The answer, strangely, is yes. The consequences of this are tremendous, as particle-wave duality has been a constant source of scientific wonder during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.

The momentum of individual photons, quantified by p= h λ , can be used to explain observations of comets and may lead to future space technologies. Electromagnetic waves and matter have both wave-like and particle-like properties. This phenomenon is defined as particle-wave duality. Key Equations momentum of a photon (deBroglie relation) p= h λ Concept Items Why don’t we feel the momentum of sunlight when we are on the beach? The momentum of a singular photon is incredibly small. The momentum is not felt because very few photons strike us at any time, and not all have momentum. The momentum of a singular photon is large, but very few photons strike us at any time. A large number of photons strike us at any time, and so their combined momentum is incredibly large.

Yes or no—Can the wavelength of an electron match that of a proton? Yes, a slow-moving electron can achieve the same momentum as a slow-moving proton. No, a fast-moving electron cannot achieve the same momentum, and hence the same wavelength, as a proton. No, an electron can achieve the same momentum, and hence not the same wavelength, as a proton. Yes, a fast-moving electron can achieve the same momentum, and hence have the same wavelength, as a slow-moving proton. Performance TaskOur scientific understanding of light has changed over time. There is evidence to support the wave model of light, just as there is evidence to support the particle model of light. Construct a demonstration that supports the wave model of light. Note—One possible method is to use a piece of aluminum foil, razor blade, and laser to demonstrate wave interference. Can you arrange these materials to create an effective demonstration? In writing, explain how evidence from your demonstration supports the wave model of light. Construct a demonstration that supports the particle model of light. Note—One possible method is to use a negatively charged electroscope, zinc plate, and three light sources of different frequencies. A red laser, a desk lamp, and ultraviolet lamp are typically used. Can you arrange these materials to demonstrate the photoelectric effect? In writing, explain how evidence from your demonstration supports the particle model of light. Teacher Support Performance Task addresses NGSS HS-PS4-3—Evaluate the claims, evidence, and reasoning behind the idea that electromagnetic radiation can be described either by a wave model or a particle model, and that for some situations one model is more useful than the other. Demonstrations chosen will vary. However, the demonstration should show interference or diffraction of light using the wave model. The method suggested implies that the student should use the razor blade to cut two parallel slits within the aluminum foil. If the slit spacing is appropriate, and the slits are parallel, an interference pattern will be created when a laser light is made to shine through the aluminum foil. This demonstration works best in a completely dark room with a flat surface less than one meter behind the foil. A pie tin may be used in place of the foil to help create the parallel lines. Demonstrations chosen may vary, though it is likely easier for students to draw a picture for the particle model. The method suggested implies that the student should charge a zinc plate negatively and attach it to the top of the electroscope. The gold leaf of the electroscope should not fall when struck with the light from the red laser or desk lamp; however, it should fall when the UV light is incident. A coulomb meter may be used in place of the electroscope and zinc plate. More information can be found here. Test Prep Extended Response Sunlight above the Earth’s atmosphere has an intensity of 1.30 kW/m2 . If this is reflected straight back from a mirror that has only a small recoil, the light’s momentum is exactly reversed, giving the mirror twice the incident momentum.

Section Key Terms energy-level diagram excited state Fraunhofer lines ground state Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle hydrogen-like atoms planetary model of the atom Rutherford scattering Rydberg constant How do we know that atoms are really there if we cannot see them with our own eyes? While often taken for granted, our knowledge of the existence and structure of atoms is the result of centuries of contemplation and experimentation. The earliest known speculation on the atom dates back to the fifth century B.C., when Greek philosophers Leucippus and Democritus contemplated whether a substance could be divided without limit into ever smaller pieces. Since then, scientists such as John Dalton (1766–1844), Amadeo Avogadro (1776–1856), and Dmitri Mendeleev (1834–1907) helped to discover the properties of that fundamental structure of matter. While much could be written about any number of important scientific philosophers, this section will focus on the role played by Ernest Rutherford (1871–1937). Though his understanding of our most elemental matter is rooted in the success of countless prior investigations, his surprising discovery about the interior of the atom is most fundamental in explaining so many well-known phenomena. Teacher Support [AL]For students that are exceptionally curious, suggest studying the writings of Democritus and determining how much of his atomic theory holds true today. Rutherford’s ExperimentIn the early 1900’s, the plum pudding model was the accepted model of the atom. Proposed in 1904 by J. J. Thomson, the model suggested that the atom was a spherical ball of positive charge, with negatively charged electrons scattered evenly throughout. In that model, the positive charges made up the pudding, while the electrons acted as isolated plums. During its short life, the model could be used to explain why most particles were neutral, although with an unbalanced number of plums, electrically charged atoms could exist. Teacher Support The plum pudding model is an outdated term many students will not understand. A chocolate chip ice cream model may work better to describe Thomson’s model to students. More advanced students may be able to describe other models on their own. When Ernest Rutherford began his gold foil experiment in 1909, it is unlikely that anyone would have expected that the plum pudding model would be challenged. However, using a radioactive source, a thin sheet of gold foil, and a phosphorescent screen, Rutherford would uncover something so great that he would later call it “the most incredible event that has ever happened to me in my life”[James, L. K. (1993). Nobel Laureates in Chemistry, 1901–1992. Washington, DC: American Chemical Society.] The experiment that Rutherford designed is shown in . As you can see in, a radioactive source was placed in a lead container with a hole in one side to produce a beam of positively charged helium particles, called alpha particles. Then, a thin gold foil sheet was placed in the beam. When the high-energy alpha particles passed through the gold foil, they were scattered. The scattering was observed from the bright spots they produced when they struck the phosphor screen. Teacher Support Take time with explaining this concept. Students may need to be reminded about phosphorescence. Additionally, radioactivity has not yet been covered in this course. At this point, it may make the most sense to state that source in the lead container “shoots small particles at high speeds.” Rutherford’s experiment gave direct evidence for the size and mass of the nucleus by scattering alpha particles from a thin gold foil. The scattering of particles suggests that the gold nuclei are very small and contain nearly all of the gold atom’s mass. Particularly significant in showing the size of the nucleus are alpha particles that scatter to very large angles, much like a soccer ball bouncing off a goalie’s head. The expectation of the plum pudding model was that the high-energy alpha particles would be scattered only slightly by the presence of the gold sheet. Because the energy of the alpha particles was much higher than those typically associated with atoms, the alpha particles should have passed through the thin foil much like a supersonic bowling ball would crash through a few dozen rows of bowling pins. Any deflection was expected to be minor, and due primarily to the electrostatic Coulomb force between the alpha particles and the foil’s interior electric charges. However, the true result was nothing of the sort. While the majority of alpha particles passed through the foil unobstructed, Rutherford and his collaborators Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden found that alpha particles occasionally were scattered to large angles, and some even came back in the direction from which they came! The result, called Rutherford scattering, implied that the gold nuclei were actually very small when compared with the size of the gold atom. As shown in , the dense nucleus is surrounded by mostly empty space of the atom, an idea verified by the fact that only 1 in 8,000 particles was scattered backward. Teacher Support [BL][OL]Students should recognize two distinct results from the gold foil experiment. (1) The gold nucleus is very dense. (2) The atom is mostly empty space. Have students identify what evidence from the gold foil experiment supports those two statements. [AL]Have the students determine whether backscattering would occur with the plum pudding model. You may also want the students to try an investigation to explore the type of calculation required to determine the diameter of the nucleus from the number of collisions; it is available at this website. An expanded view of the atoms in the gold foil in Rutherford’s experiment. Circles represent the atoms that are about 10−10 m in diameter, while the dots represent the nuclei that are about 10−15 m in diameter. To be visible, the dots are much larger than scale—if the nuclei were actually the size of the dots, each atom would have a diameter of about five meters! Most alpha particles crash through but are relatively unaffected because of their high energy and the electron’s small mass. Some, however, strike a nucleus and are scattered straight back. A detailed analysis of their interaction gives the size and mass of the nucleus. Although the results of the experiment were published by his colleagues in 1909, it took Rutherford two years to convince himself of their meaning. Rutherford later wrote: “It was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you. On consideration, I realized that this scattering backwards ... [meant] ... the greatest part of the mass of the atom was concentrated in a tiny nucleus.” In 1911, Rutherford published his analysis together with a proposed model of the atom, which was in part based on Geiger’s work from the previous year. As a result of the paper, the size of the nucleus was determined to be about 10 −15 m, or 100,000 times smaller than the atom. That implies a huge density, on the order of 10 15 g/cm3, much greater than any macroscopic matter.Based on the size and mass of the nucleus revealed by his experiment, as well as the mass of electrons, Rutherford proposed the planetary model of the atom. The planetary model of the atom pictures low-mass electrons orbiting a large-mass nucleus. The sizes of the electron orbits are large compared with the size of the nucleus, and most of the atom is a vacuum. The model is analogous to how low-mass planets in our solar system orbit the large-mass Sun. In the atom, the attractive Coulomb force is analogous to gravitation in the planetary system (see ). Rutherford’s planetary model of the atom incorporates the characteristics of the nucleus, electrons, and the size of the atom. The model was the first to recognize the structure of atoms, in which low-mass electrons orbit a very small, massive nucleus in orbits much larger than the nucleus. The atom is mostly empty and is analogous to our planetary system. Rutherford Scattering How did Rutherford figure out the structure of the atom without being able to see it? Explore the answer through this simulation of the famous experiment in which he disproved the plum pudding model by observing alpha particles bouncing off atoms and determining that they must have a small core. As you progress through the model of the atom, consider the effect that experimentation has on the scientific process. Ask yourself the following: What would our model of the atom be without Rutherford’s gold foil experiment? What further understanding of the atom would not have been gained? How would that affect our current technologies? Though often confusing, experiments taking place today to further understand composition of the atom could perhaps have a similar effect. Absorption and Emission Spectra Teacher Support Before beginning this section, it is important to review the concept of quantization. What does it mean to be quantized? Provide examples of concepts that are quantum and concepts that are not. The review will make understanding emission spectra and orbital states much simpler. [EL]Spectrum refers to the range of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a form of matter or energy. The plural is spectra. In 1900, Max Planck recognized that all energy radiated from a source is emitted by atoms in quantum states. How would that radical idea relate to the interior of an atom? The answer was first found by investigating the spectrum of light or emission spectrum produced when a gas is highly energized. shows how to isolate the emission spectrum of one such gas. The gas is placed in the discharge tube at the left, where it is energized to the point at which it begins to radiate energy or emit light. The radiated light is channeled by a thin slit and then passed through a diffraction grating, which will separate the light into its constituent wavelengths. The separated light will then strike the photographic film on the right. Teacher Support Be sure to explain how the discharge tube begins to radiate energy. When the gas is placed in an electric field, it can be supplied with enough energy that it begins to radiate. Focusing on an increase in energy via electric field will help students separate the concept from the continuous energy spectrum created by increasing the temperature of a radiating black body. If a diffraction grating is not handy, can be modeled using a prism in its place. The line spectrum shown in part (b) of is the output shown on the film for excited iron. Note that this spectrum is not continuous but discrete. In other words, only particular wavelengths are emitted by the iron source. Why would that be the case? Part (a) shows, from left to right, a discharge tube, slit, and diffraction grating producing a line spectrum. Part (b) shows the emission spectrum for iron. The discrete lines imply quantized energy states for the atoms that produce them. The line spectrum for each element is unique, providing a powerful and much-used analytical tool, and many line spectra were well known for many years before they could be explained with physics. (credit:(b) Yttrium91, Wikimedia Commons) The spectrum of light created by excited iron shows a variety of discrete wavelengths emitted within the visible spectrum. Each element, when excited to the appropriate degree, will create a discrete emission spectrum as in part (b) of . However, the wavelengths emitted will vary from element to element. The emission spectrum for iron was chosen for solely because a substantial portion of its emission spectrum is within the visible spectrum. shows the emission spectrum for hydrogen. Note that, while discrete, a large portion of hydrogen emission takes place in the ultraviolet and infrared regions. Teacher Support Show pictures of glowing neon, argon, and helium gases. Have students speculate on the visible line spectra for those gases. A schematic of the hydrogen spectrum shows several series named for those who contributed most to their determination. Part of the Balmer series is in the visible spectrum, while the Lyman series is entirely in the ultraviolet, and the Paschen series and others are in the infrared. Values of nf and ni are shown for some of the lines. Their importance will be described shortly. Just as an emission spectrum shows all discrete wavelengths emitted by a gas, an absorption spectrum will show all light that is absorbed by a gas. Black lines exist where the wavelengths are absorbed, with the remainder of the spectrum lit by light is free to pass through. What relationship do you think exists between the black lines of a gas’s absorption spectrum and the colored lines of its emission spectrum? shows the absorption spectrum of the Sun. The black lines are called Fraunhofer lines, and they correspond to the wavelengths absorbed by gases in the Sun’s exterior. Teacher Support [AL]Have students explore how Fraunhofer lines are used by astronomers to determine the composition of stars. [BL][OL]Ask the students to speculate on the absorption spectrum provided by a perfect emitter or a perfect absorber. What would the absorption spectrum look like for a black hole? The absorption spectrum of the Sun. The black lines appear at wavelengths absorbed by the Sun’s gas exterior. The energetic photons emitted from the Sun’s interior are absorbed by gas in its exterior and reemitted in directions away from the observer. That results in dark lines within the absorption spectrum. The lines are called Fraunhofer lines, in honor of the German physicist who discovered them. Lines similar to those are used to determine the chemical composition of stars well outside our solar system. Bohr’s Explanation of the Hydrogen Spectrum To tie the unique signatures of emission spectra to the composition of the atom itself would require clever thinking. Niels Bohr (1885–1962), a Danish physicist, did just that, by making immediate use of Rutherford’s planetary model of the atom. Bohr, shown in , became convinced of its validity and spent part of 1912 at Rutherford’s laboratory. In 1913, after returning to Copenhagen, he began publishing his theory of the simplest atom, hydrogen, based on Rutherford’s planetary model. Niels Bohr, Danish physicist, used the planetary model of the atom to explain the atomic spectrum and size of the hydrogen atom. His many contributions to the development of atomic physics and quantum mechanics, his personal influence on many students and colleagues, and his personal integrity, especially in the face of Nazi oppression, earned him a prominent place in history. (credit: Unknown Author, Wikimedia Commons)Bohr was able to derive the formula for the hydrogen spectrum using basic physics, the planetary model of the atom, and some very important new conjectures. His first conjecture was that only certain orbits are allowed: In other words, in an atom, the orbits of electrons are quantized. Each quantized orbit has a different distinct energy, and electrons can move to a higher orbit by absorbing energy or drop to a lower orbit by emitting energy. Because of the quantized orbits, the amount of energy emitted or absorbed must also be quantized, producing the discrete spectra seen in and . In equation form, the amount of energy absorbed or emitted can be found as ΔE= E i − E f , where E i refers to the energy of the initial quantized orbit, and E f refers to the energy of the final orbits. Furthermore, the wavelength emitted can be found using the equation hf= E i − E f , and relating the wavelength to the frequency found using the equation v=fλ , where v corresponds to the speed of light. It makes sense that energy is involved in changing orbits. For example, a burst of energy is required for a satellite to climb to a higher orbit. What is not expected is that atomic orbits should be quantized. Quantization is not observed for satellites or planets, which can have any orbit, given the proper energy (see ). The planetary model of the atom, as modified by Bohr, has the orbits of the electrons quantized. Only certain orbits are allowed, explaining why atomic spectra are discrete or quantized. The energy carried away from an atom by a photon comes from the electron dropping from one allowed orbit to another and is thus quantized. The same is true for atomic absorption of photons. shows an energy-level diagram, a convenient way to display energy states. Each of the horizontal lines corresponds to the energy of an electron in a different orbital. Energy is plotted vertically with the lowest or ground state at the bottom and with excited states above. The vertical arrow downwards shows energy being emitted out of the atom due to an electron dropping from one excited state to another. That would correspond to a line shown on the atom’s emission spectrum. The Lyman series shown in results from electrons dropping to the ground state, while the Balmer and Paschen series result to electrons dropping to the n = 2 and n = 3 states, respectively. An energy-level diagram plots energy vertically and is useful in visualizing the energy states of a system and the transitions between them. This diagram is for the hydrogen-atom electrons, showing a transition between two orbits having energies E 4 and E 2 . The energy transition results in a Balmer series line in an emission spectrum. Teacher Support [BL][OL]Quiz the students at this time. Show a large energy-level diagram on the board. Draw an arrow upward and ask whether energy is being emitted or absorbed. Have students draw an arrow showing more energy being absorbed. Draw a downward arrow and ask whether energy is being emitted or absorbed. Have the students compare the amount of energy emitted for various energy-level drops. [AL]Have a student draw a planetary model to match the energy-level diagram shown above. Have students model the changes in energy states on their planetary model as they are shown on the energy-level diagram. Encourage students to use terminology such as Balmer series, Lyman series, and Paschen series in their explanations. Energy and Wavelength of Emitted Hydrogen Spectra Teacher Support The negative value in the following equation can be difficult for students to understand. If you have already discussed potential energy in large-scale gravitational systems, you may remind students of that application prior to this discussion. The energy associated with a particular orbital of a hydrogen atom can be found using the equation E n =− 13.6eV n 2 (n=1,2,3,...), where n corresponds to the orbital value from the atom’s nucleus. The negative value in the equation is based upon a baseline energy of zero when the electron is infinitely far from the atom. As a result, the negative value shows that energy is necessary to free the electron from its orbital state. The minimum energy to free the electron is also referred to as its binding energy. The equation is only valid for atoms with single electrons in their orbital shells (like hydrogen). For ionized atoms similar to hydrogen, the following formula may be used. E n = Z 2 n 2 E o ( n=1,2,3,... ) Please note that E o corresponds to –13.6 eV, as mentioned earlier. Additionally, Z refers to the atomic number of the element studied. The atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus—it is different for each element. The above equation is derived from some basic physics principles, namely conservation of energy, conservation of angular momentum, Coulomb’s law, and centripetal force. There are three derivations that result in the orbital energy equations, and they are shown below. While you can use the energy equations without understanding the derivations, they will help to remind you of just how valuable those fundamental concepts are. Teacher Support The following three derivations are meant for advanced students. If you have a student that is at or below level, you may skip them and progress directly to . Derivation 1 (Finding the Radius of an Orbital) One primary difference between the planetary model of the solar system and the planetary model of the atom is the cause of the circular motion. While gravitation causes the motion of orbiting planets around an interior star, the Coulomb force is responsible for the circular shape of the electron’s orbit. The magnitude of the centripetal force is m e v 2 r n , while the magnitude of the Coulomb force is k( Z q e )( q e ) r e 2 . The assumption here is that the nucleus is more massive than the stationary electron, and the electron orbits about it. That is consistent with the planetary model of the atom. Equating the Coulomb force and the centripetal force, m e v 2 r n = k(Z q e )( q e ) r e 2 , which yields r n = k( Z q e 2 ) m v 2 . Derivation 2 (Finding the Velocity of the Orbiting Electron) Bohr was clever enough to find a way to calculate the electron orbital energies in hydrogen. That was an important first step that has been improved upon, but it is well worth repeating here, because it does correctly describe many characteristics of hydrogen. Assuming circular orbits, Bohr proposed that the angular momentum L of an electron in its orbit is also quantized, that is, it has only specific, discrete values. The value for L is given by the formula L= m e v r n =n h 2π (n=1,2,3,...), where L is the angular momentum, me is the electron’s mass, rn is the radius of the n th orbit, and h is Planck’s constant. Note that angular momentum is L=Iω . For a small object at a radius r, I=m r 2 , and ω= v r , so that L=Iω=( m r 2 )( v r )=mvr. Quantization says that the value of mvr can only be equal to h / 2, 2h / 2, 3h / 2, etc. At the time, Bohr himself did not know why angular momentum should be quantized, but by using that assumption, he was able to calculate the energies in the hydrogen spectrum, something no one else had done at the time. Derivation 3 (Finding the Energy of the Orbiting Electron) To get the electron orbital energies, we start by noting that the electron energy is the sum of its kinetic and potential energy. E n =KE+PE Kinetic energy is the familiar KE= 1 2 m v 2 , assuming the electron is not moving at a relativistic speed. Potential energy for the electron is electrical, or PE= q e V , where V is the potential due to the nucleus, which looks like a point charge. The nucleus has a positive charge Z q e ; thus, V= kZ q e r n , recalling an earlier equation for the potential due to a point charge from the chapter on Electricity and Magnetism. Since the electron’s charge is negative, we see that PE= −kZ q e 2 r n . Substituting the expressions for KE and PE, E n = 1 2 m e v 2 − kZ q e 2 r n . Now we solve for rn and v using the equation for angular momentum L= m e v r n =n h 2π (n=1,2,3,...) , giving v=n h 2π m e r n (n=1,2,3,...) and r n =n h 2π m e v (n=1,2,3,...). Substituting the expression for rn and v into the above expressions for energy (KE and PE), and performing algebraic manipulation, yields E n =− Z 2 n 2 E o (n=1,2,3,...) for the orbital energies of hydrogen-like atoms. Here, Eo is the ground-state energy (n = 1) for hydrogen (Z = 1) and is given by E o = 2 π 2 q e 4 m e k 2 h 2 =13.6eV . Thus, for hydrogen, E n =− 13.6eV n 2 (n=1,2,3,...). The relationship between orbital energies and orbital states for the hydrogen atom can be seen in . Energy-level diagram for hydrogen showing the Lyman, Balmer, and Paschen series of transitions. The orbital energies are calculated using the above equation, first derived by Bohr. A hydrogen atom is struck by a photon. How much energy must be absorbed from the photon to raise the electron of the hydrogen atom from its ground state to its second orbital? Strategy The hydrogen atom has an atomic number of Z = 1. Raising the electron from the ground state to its second orbital will increase its orbital level from n = 1 to n = 2. The energy determined will be measured in electron-volts. Solution The amount of energy necessary to cause the change in electron state is the difference between the final and initial energies of the electron. The final energy state of the electron can be found using E n = Z 2 n 2 E o ( n=1,2,3,... ) . Knowing the n and Z values for the hydrogen atom, and knowing that Eo = –13.6 eV, the result is E f = 1 2 2 2 (−13.6eV)=−3.4eV. The original amount of energy associated with the electron is equivalent to the ground state orbital, or E O = 1 2 1 2 (−13.6eV)=−13.6eV. The amount of energy necessary to change the orbital state of the electron can be found by determining the electron’s change in energy. ΔE= E f − E o =( −3.4eV )−( −13.6eV )=+10.2eV Discussion The energy required to change the orbital state of the electron is positive. That means that for the electron to move to a state with greater energy, energy must be added to the atom. Should the electron drop back down to its original energy state, a change of –10.2 eV would take place, and 10.2 eV of energy would be emitted from the atom. Just as only quantum amounts of energy may be absorbed by the atom, only quantum amounts of energy can be emitted from the atom. That helps to explain many of the quantum light effects that you have learned about previously. Characteristic X-Ray Energy Calculate the approximate energy of an X-ray emitted for an n = 2 to n = 1 transition in a tungsten anode in an X-ray tube. Strategy How do we calculate energies in a multiple-electron atom? In the case of characteristic X-rays, the following approximate calculation is reasonable. Characteristic X-rays are produced when an inner-shell vacancy is filled. Inner-shell electrons are nearer the nucleus than others in an atom and thus feel little net effect from the others. That is similar to what happens inside a charged conductor, where its excess charge is distributed over the surface so that it produces no electric field inside. It is reasonable to assume the inner-shell electrons have hydrogen-like energies, as given by E n = Z 2 n 2 E o ( n=1,2,3,... ) For tungsten, Z = 74, so that the effective charge is 73. Solution The amount of energy given off as an X-ray is found using ΔE=hf= E i − E f , where E f =− Z 2 1 2 E o =− 73 2 1 ( 13.6eV )=−72.5keV and E i =− Z 2 2 2 E o =− 73 2 4 (13.6eV)=−18.1keV. Thus, ΔE= E i − E f =( −18.1keV )−( −72.5keV )=54.4keV. Discussion This large photon energy is typical of characteristic X-rays from heavy elements. It is large compared with other atomic emissions because it is produced when an inner-shell vacancy is filled, and inner-shell electrons are tightly bound. Characteristic X-ray energies become progressively larger for heavier elements because their energy increases approximately as Z2. Significant accelerating voltage is needed to create such inner-shell vacancies, because other shells are filled and you cannot simply bump one electron to a higher filled shell. You must remove it from the atom completely. In the case of tungsten, at least 72.5 kV is needed. Tungsten is a common anode material in X-ray tubes; so much of the energy of the impinging electrons is absorbed, raising its temperature, that a high-melting-point material like tungsten is required. Teacher Support As with the previous section, the following derivation may be omitted for students below level. If it is omitted, students should pick up at . The wavelength of light emitted by an atom can also be determined through basic derivations. Let us consider the energy of a photon emitted from a hydrogen atom in a downward transition, given by the equation ΔE=hf= E i − E f Substituting E n =( −13.6eV n 2 ) , we get hf=( 13.6eV )( 1 n f 2 − 1 n i 2 ). Dividing both sides of the equation by hc gives us an expression for 1 λ , hf hc = f c = 1 λ = 13.6eV hc ( 1 n f 2 − 1 n i 2 ). It can be shown that ( 13.6eV hc )= (13.6eV)(1.602× 10 −19 J/eV) (6.602× 10 −34 J⋅s)(2.998× 10 8 m/s) =1.097× 10 7 m −1 =R, where R is the Rydberg constant. Simplified, the formula for determining emitted wavelength can now be written as 1 λ =R( 1 n f 2 − 1 n i 2 ). What wavelength of light is emitted by an electron dropping from the third orbital to the ground state of a hydrogen atom? Strategy The ground state of a hydrogen atom is considered the first orbital of the atom. As a result, nf = 1 and ni = 3. The Rydberg constant has already been determined and will be constant regardless of atom chosen. Solution 1 λ =R( 1 n f 2 − 1 n i 2 ) For the equation above, calculate wavelength based on the known energy states. 1 λ =1.097× 10 7 ( 1 1 2 − 1 3 2 )=9.751× 10 6 m −1 Rearranging the equation for wavelength yields λ=1.026× 10 −7 m=102.6nm. Discussion This wavelength corresponds to light in the ultraviolet spectrum. As a result, we would not be able to see the photon of light emitted when an electron drops from its third to first energy state. However, it is worth noting that by supplying light of wavelength precisely 102.6 nm, we can cause the electron in hydrogen to move from its first to its third orbital state. Teacher Support Before progressing further, review Bohr’s theory with the students. [BL][OL]Have students describe what is quantized and how quantum orbitals relate to the wavelengths of energy emitted. [AL]Have students explain how Bohr’s theory is supported by blackbody radiation and the photoelectric effect. Explain that the photoelectric effect occurs when photons hitting the surface of a solar cell create an electric current in the cell, and that the photoelectric effect allows sunlight to be converted directly into electricity. See whether students can construct a deeper understanding behind the observations mentioned in the chapter on the Quantum Nature of Light. Limits of Bohr’s Theory and the Quantum Model of the AtomThere are limits to Bohr’s theory. It does not account for the interaction of bound electrons, so it cannot be fully applied to multielectron atoms, even one as simple as the two-electron helium atom. Bohr’s model is what we call semiclassical. The orbits are quantized (nonclassical) but are assumed to be simple circular paths (classical). As quantum mechanics was developed, it became clear that there are no well-defined orbits; rather, there are clouds of probability. Additionally, Bohr’s theory did not explain that some spectral lines are doublets or split into two when examined closely. While we shall examine a few of those aspects of quantum mechanics in more detail, it should be kept in mind that Bohr did not fail. Rather, he made very important steps along the path to greater knowledge and laid the foundation for all of atomic physics that has since evolved. DeBroglie’s Waves Teacher Support If it has been a while since students have seen a standing wave, show them a standing wave using a slinky or electric oscillator. Show that a standing wave pattern can only emerge for specific frequencies. Similar to a guitar string only playing a particular frequency when plucked, the electron can only fit into a particular orbital when provided with the appropriate amount of energy. Following Bohr’s initial work on the hydrogen atom, a decade was to pass before Louis de Broglie proposed that matter has wave properties. The wave-like properties of matter were subsequently confirmed by observations of electron interference when scattered from crystals. Electrons can exist only in locations where they interfere constructively. How does that affect electrons in atomic orbits? When an electron is bound to an atom, its wavelength must fit into a small space, something like a standing wave on a string (see ). Orbits in which an electron can constructively interfere with itself are allowed. All orbits in which constructive interference cannot occur are not able to exist. Thus, only certain orbits are allowed. The wave nature of an electron, according to de Broglie, is why the orbits are quantized! (a) Standing waves on a string have a wavelength related to the length of the string, allowing them to interfere constructively. (b) If we imagine the string formed into a closed circle, we get a rough idea of how electrons in circular orbits can interfere constructively. (c) If the wavelength does not fit into the circumference, the electron interferes destructively; it cannot exist in such an orbit. For a circular orbit, constructive interference occurs when the electron’s wavelength fits neatly into the circumference, so that wave crests always align with crests and wave troughs align with troughs, as shown in (b). More precisely, when an integral multiple of the electron’s wavelength equals the circumference of the orbit, constructive interference is obtained. In equation form, the condition for constructive interference and an allowed electron orbit is n λ n =2π r n (n=1,2,3,...), where λ n is the electron’s wavelength and rn is the radius of that circular orbit. shows the third and fourth orbitals of a hydrogen atom. The third and fourth allowed circular orbits have three and four wavelengths, respectively, in their circumferences. Heisenberg Uncertainty How does determining the location of an electron change its trajectory? The answer is fundamentally important—measurement affects the system being observed. It is impossible to measure a physical quantity exactly, and greater precision in measuring one quantity produces less precision in measuring a related quantity. It was Werner Heisenberg who first stated that limit to knowledge in 1929 as a result of his work on quantum mechanics and the wave characteristics of all particles (see ). Werner Heisenberg was the physicist who developed the first version of true quantum mechanics. Not only did his work give a description of nature on the very small scale, it also changed our view of the availability of knowledge. Although he is universally recognized for the importance of his work by receiving the Nobel Prize in 1932, for example, Heisenberg remained in Germany during World War II and headed the German effort to build a nuclear bomb, permanently alienating himself from most of the scientific community. (credit: Unknown Author, Wikimedia Commons)For example, you can measure the position of a moving electron by scattering light or other electrons from it. However, by doing so, you are giving the electron energy, and therefore imparting momentum to it. As a result, the momentum of the electron is affected and cannot be determined precisely. This change in momentum could be anywhere from close to zero up to the relative momentum of the electron ( p≈h/λ ). Note that, in this case, the particle is an electron, but the principle applies to any particle. Viewing the electron through the model of wave-particle duality, Heisenberg recognized that, because a wave is not located at one fixed point in space, there is an uncertainty associated with any electron’s position. That uncertainty in position, Δx , is approximately equal to the wavelength of the particle. That is, Δx≈λ . There is an interesting trade-off between position and momentum. The uncertainty in an electron’s position can be reduced by using a shorter-wavelength electron, since Δx≈λ . But shortening the wavelength increases the uncertainty in momentum, since Δp≈h/λ . Conversely, the uncertainty in momentum can be reduced by using a longer-wavelength electron, but that increases the uncertainty in position. Mathematically, you can express the trade-off by multiplying the uncertainties. The wavelength cancels, leaving ΔxΔp≈h. Therefore, if one uncertainty is reduced, the other must increase so that their product is ≈h . With the use of advanced mathematics, Heisenberg showed that the best that can be done in a simultaneous measurement of position and momentum is ΔxΔp≥ h 4π . That relationship is known as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Teacher Support [BL][OL]Another model for explaining the uncertainty principle for students struggling with the concept: Imagine searching for a floating balloon in a dark room. When your hand strikes the balloon, you provide an impulse and move it from its original spot. While you learned the position of the object, you disturbed it during your search. As a result, it has a new momentum that is unknown! The Quantum Model of the Atom Because of the wave characteristic of matter, the idea of well-defined orbits gives way to a model in which there is a cloud of probability, consistent with Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. shows how the principle applies to the ground state of hydrogen. If you try to follow the electron in some well-defined orbit using a probe that has a wavelength small enough to measure position accurately, you will instead knock the electron out of its orbit. Each measurement of the electron’s position will find it to be in a definite location somewhere near the nucleus. Repeated measurements reveal a cloud of probability like that in the figure, with each speck the location determined by a single measurement. There is not a well-defined, circular-orbit type of distribution. Nature again proves to be different on a small scale than on a macroscopic scale. Teacher Support [BL][OL]Upon viewing , have students explain how the image is supported by Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. [AL]Have students explain how DeBroglie’s waves tie to . How would the electron cloud appear if the picture were of a carbon atom? The ground state of a hydrogen atom has a probability cloud describing the position of its electron. The probability of finding the electron is proportional to the darkness of the cloud. The electron can be closer or farther than the Bohr radius, but it is very unlikely to be a great distance from the nucleus. Models of the Hydrogen Atom How did scientists figure out the structure of atoms without looking at them? Try out different models by shooting light at the atom. Use this simulation to see how the prediction of the model matches the experimental results. Check Your Understanding Section Summary Rutherford’s gold foil experiment provided evidence that the atom is composed of a small, dense nucleus with electrons occupying the mostly empty space around it. Analysis of emission spectra shows that energy is emitted from energized gas in discrete quantities. The Bohr model of the atom describes electrons existing in discrete orbits, with discrete energies emitted and absorbed as the electrons decrease and increase in orbital energy. The energy emitted or absorbed by an electron as it changes energy state can be determined with the equation ΔE= E i − E f , where E n = Z 2 n 2 E o ( n=1,2,3,... ) . The wavelength of energy absorbed or emitted by an electron as it changes energy state can be determined by the equation 1 λ =R( 1 n f 2 − 1 n i 2 ) , where R=1.097× 10 7 m −1 . Described as an electron cloud, the quantum model of the atom is the result of de Broglie waves and Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle.

On a macroscopic level, the orbital states do exist for satellites orbiting Earth but are too closely spaced for us to see. On a macroscopic level, the orbital states do not exist for satellites orbiting Earth. On a macroscopic level, we cannot control the amount of energy that we give to an artificial satellite and thus control its orbital altitude. On a macroscopic level, we cannot control the amount of energy that we give to an artificial satellite but we can control its orbital altitude. Do standing waves explain why electron orbitals are quantized? no yes Some terms referring to the observation of light include emission spectrum and absorption spectrum. Based on these definitions, what would a reflection spectrum describe? The reflection spectrum would describe when incident waves are selectively reflected by a substance. The reflection spectrum would describe when incident waves are completely reflected by a substance. The reflection spectrum would describe when incident waves are not absorbed by a substance. The reflection spectrum would describe when incident waves are completely absorbed by a substance. Test Prep Multiple Choice If electrons are negatively charged and the nucleus is positively charged, why do they not attract and collide with each other? The pull from the nucleus provides a centrifugal force, which is not strong enough to draw the electrons into the nucleus. The pull from the nucleus provides a centripetal force, which is not strong enough to draw the electrons into the nucleus. The pull from the nucleus provides a helical motion. The pull from the nucleus provides a cycloid motion. Test Prep Short Answer Why do Bohrs calculations for electron energies not work for all atoms? In atoms with more than one electron is an atomic shell, the electrons will interact. That requires a more complex formula than Bohrs calculations accounted for. In atoms with 10 or more electorns in an atomic shell, the electrons will interact. That requires a more complex formula than Bohrs calculations accounted for. In atoms with more than one electron in an atomic shell, the electrons will not interact. That requires a more complex formula than Bohrs calculations accounted for. In atoms with 10 or more electrons in an atomic shell, the electrons will not interact. That requires a more complex formula than Bohrs calculations accounted for.

Section Key Terms alpha decay atomic number beta decay gamma decay Geiger tube isotope mass number nucleons radioactive radioactive decay radioactivity scintillator strong nuclear force transmutation Teacher Support [BL][OL][AL]As in the beginning of Section 1, have students create a list of facts they have learned about the atom. Have the students update their list throughout this section. There is an ongoing quest to find the substructures of matter. At one time, it was thought that atoms would be the ultimate substructure. However, just when the first direct evidence of atoms was obtained, it became clear that they have a substructure and a tiny nucleus. The nucleus itself has spectacular characteristics. For example, certain nuclei are unstable, and their decay emits radiations with energies millions of times greater than atomic energies. Some of the mysteries of nature, such as why the core of Earth remains molten and how the Sun produces its energy, are explained by nuclear phenomena. The exploration of radioactivity and the nucleus has revealed new fundamental particles, forces, and conservation laws. That exploration has evolved into a search for further underlying structures, such as quarks. In this section, we will explore the fundamentals of the nucleus and nuclear radioactivity. The Structure of the Nucleus At this point, you are likely familiar with the neutron and proton, the two fundamental particles that make up the nucleus of an atom. Those two particles, collectively called nucleons, make up the small interior portion of the atom. Both particles have nearly the same mass, although the neutron is about two parts in 1,000 more massive. The mass of a proton is equivalent to 1,836 electrons, while the mass of a neutron is equivalent to that of 1,839 electrons. That said, each of the particles is significantly more massive than the electron. When describing the mass of objects on the scale of nucleons and atoms, it is most reasonable to measure their mass in terms of atoms. The atomic mass unit (u) was originally defined so that a neutral carbon atom would have a mass of exactly 12 u. Given that protons and neutrons are approximately the same mass, that there are six protons and six neutrons in a carbon atom, and that the mass of an electron is minuscule in comparison, measuring this way allows for both protons and neutrons to have masses close to 1 u. shows the mass of protons, neutrons, and electrons on the new scale. For most conceptual situations, the difference in mass between the proton and neutron is insubstantial. In fact, for calculations that require fewer than four significant digits, both the proton and neutron masses may be considered equivalent to one atomic mass unit. However, when determining the amount of energy released in a nuclear reaction, as in , the difference in mass cannot be ignored. Another other useful mass unit on the atomic scale is the MeV/ c 2 . While rarely used in most contexts, it is convenient when one uses the equation E=m c 2 , as will be addressed later in this text. Atomic Masses for Multiple Units Proton Mass Neutron Mass Electron Mass Kilograms (kg) 1.673× 10 −27 1.675× 10 −27 9.109× 10 −31 Atomic mass units (u) 1.007 1.009 5.486× 10 −4 To more completely characterize nuclei, let us also consider two other important quantities: the atomic number and the mass number. The atomic number, Z, represents the number of protons within a nucleus. That value determines the elemental quality of each atom. Every carbon atom, for instance, has a Z value of 6, whereas every oxygen atom has a Z value of 8. For clarification, only oxygen atoms may have a Z value of 8. If the Z value is not 8, the atom cannot be oxygen. The mass number, A, represents the total number of protons and neutrons, or nucleons, within an atom. For an ordinary carbon atom the mass number would be 12, as there are typically six neutrons accompanying the six protons within the atom. In the case of carbon, the mass would be exactly 12 u. For oxygen, with a mass number of 16, the atomic mass is 15.994915 u. Of course, the difference is minor and can be ignored for most scenarios. Again, because the mass of an electron is so small compared to the nucleons, the mass number and the atomic mass can be essentially equivalent. shows an example of Lithium-7, which has an atomic number of 3 and a mass number of 7. Teacher Support [BL]Students may confuse the terms mass number and atomic number. Remind them that the mass is based on both protons and neutrons and so mass number is a measure of both combined. The atomic number differentiates between two different atoms, which only protons can do. A few examples showing pictures of nuclei and having students identify the mass and atomic numbers of each should help. How does the mass number help to differentiate one atom from another? If each atom of carbon has an atomic number of 6, then what is the value of including the mass number at all? The intent of the mass number is to differentiate between various isotopes of an atom. The term isotope refers to the variation of atoms based upon the number of neutrons within their nucleus. While it is most common for there to be six neutrons accompanying the six protons within a carbon atom, it is possible to find carbon atoms with seven neutrons or eight neutrons. Those carbon atoms are respectively referred to as carbon-13 and carbon-14 atoms, with their mass numbers being their primary distinction. The isotope distinction is an important one to make, as the number of neutrons within an atom can affect a number of its properties, not the least of which is nuclear stability. Lithium-7 has three protons and four neutrons within its nucleus. As a result, its mass number is 7, while its atomic number is 3. The actual mass of the atom is 7.016 u. Lithium 7 is an isotope of lithium. Teacher Support Point out to students that the number of electrons is irrelevant to discussions of mass number, atomic number, and isotopes. To more easily identify various atoms, their atomic number and mass number are typically written in a form of representation called the nuclide. The nuclide form appears as follows: A Z X N , where X is the atomic symbol and N represents the number of neutrons. Let us look at a few examples of nuclides expressed in the A Z X N notation. The nucleus of the simplest atom, hydrogen, is a single proton, or H 1 1 (the zero for no neutrons is often omitted). To check the symbol, refer to the periodic table—you see that the atomic number Z of hydrogen is 1. Since you are given that there are no neutrons, the mass number A is also 1. There is a scarce form of hydrogen found in nature called deuterium; its nucleus has one proton and one neutron and, hence, twice the mass of common hydrogen. The symbol for deuterium is, thus, 1 2 H 2 . An even rarer—and radioactive—form of hydrogen is called tritium, since it has a single proton and two neutrons, and it is written 1 3 H 2 . The three varieties of hydrogen have nearly identical chemistries, but the nuclei differ greatly in mass, stability, and other characteristics. Again, the different nuclei are referred to as isotopes of the same element.There is some redundancy in the symbols A, X, Z, and N. If the element X is known, then Z can be found in a periodic table. If both A and X are known, then N can also be determined by first finding Z; then, N = A – Z. Thus the simpler notation for nuclides is A X, which is sufficient and is most commonly used. For example, in this simpler notation, the three isotopes of hydrogen are 1 H , 2 H , and 3 H . For 238 U , should we need to know, we can determine that Z = 92 for uranium from the periodic table, and thus, N = 238 − 92 = 146. Teacher Support This explanation is provided to help students understand nomenclature later on in the text. However, it may be useful to have students practice writing nuclide notation to build confidence with the concept. Radioactivity and Nuclear Forces In 1896, the French physicist Antoine Henri Becquerel (1852–1908) noticed something strange. When a uranium-rich mineral called pitchblende was placed on a completely opaque envelope containing a photographic plate, it darkened spots on the photographic plate.. Becquerel reasoned that the pitchblende must emit invisible rays capable of penetrating the opaque material. Stranger still was that no light was shining on the pitchblende, which means that the pitchblende was emitting the invisible rays continuously without having any energy input! There is an apparent violation of the law of conservation of energy, one that scientists can now explain using Einstein’s famous equation E=m c 2 . It was soon evident that Becquerel’s rays originate in the nuclei of the atoms and have other unique characteristics. To this point, most reactions you have studied have been chemical reactions, which are reactions involving the electrons surrounding the atoms. However, two types of experimental evidence implied that Becquerel’s rays did not originate with electrons, but instead within the nucleus of an atom. First, the radiation is found to be only associated with certain elements, such as uranium. Whether uranium was in the form of an element or compound was irrelevant to its radiation. In addition, the presence of radiation does not vary with temperature, pressure, or ionization state of the uranium atom. Since all of those factors affect electrons in an atom, the radiation cannot come from electron transitions, as atomic spectra do. The huge energy emitted during each event is the second piece of evidence that the radiation cannot be atomic. Nuclear radiation has energies on the order of 106 eV per event, which is much greater than typical atomic energies that are a few eV, such as those observed in spectra and chemical reactions, and more than ten times as high as the most energetic X-rays. Teacher Support To emphasize the point that most reactions are chemical, have students brainstorm a list of reactions from chemistry class. Have them describe the changes that cause the reactions to take place. Are the reactions the result of nuclear interactions or electron interactions? But why would reactions within the nucleus take place? And what would cause an apparently stable structure to begin emitting energy? Was there something special about Becquerel’s uranium-rich pitchblende? To answer those questions, it is necessary to look into the structure of the nucleus. Though it is perhaps surprising, you will find that many of the same principles that we observe on a macroscopic level still apply to the nucleus. Nuclear Stability A variety of experiments indicate that a nucleus behaves something like a tightly packed ball of nucleons, as illustrated in . Those nucleons have large kinetic energies and, thus, move rapidly in very close contact. Nucleons can be separated by a large force, such as in a collision with another nucleus, but strongly resist being pushed closer together. The most compelling evidence that nucleons are closely packed in a nucleus is that the radius of a nucleus, r, is found to be approximately r= r o A 1 3 , where r o = 1.2 femtometer (fm) and A is the mass number of the nucleus. Note that r 3 ∝A . Since many nuclei are spherical, and the volume of a sphere is V=( 4 3 )π r 3 , we see that V∝A —that is, the volume of a nucleus is proportional to the number of nucleons in it. That is what you expect if you pack nucleons so close that there is no empty space between them. Nucleons are held together by nuclear forces and resist both being pulled apart and pushed inside one another. The volume of the nucleus is the sum of the volumes of the nucleons in it, here shown in different colors to represent protons and neutrons. So what forces hold a nucleus together? After all, the nucleus is very small and its protons, being positive, should exert tremendous repulsive forces on one another. Considering that, it seems that the nucleus would be forced apart, not together! The answer is that a previously unknown force holds the nucleus together and makes it into a tightly packed ball of nucleons. This force is known as the strong nuclear force. The strong force has such a short range that it quickly fall to zero over a distance of only 10–15 meters. However, like glue, it is very strong when the nucleons get close to one another. Teacher Support The relationship between the repulsive Coulomb force and the attractive nuclear force can be modeled using a balloon. Squeeze the balloon, or have one student hold a balloon while the other pushes on it. The pressure of the air inside the balloon will model the Coulomb force while the push from the student models the nuclear force. The balancing of the electromagnetic force with the nuclear forces is what allows the nucleus to maintain its spherical shape. If, for any reason, the electromagnetic force should overcome the nuclear force, components of the nucleus would be projected outward, creating the very radiation that Becquerel discovered! Understanding why the nucleus would break apart can be partially explained using . The balance between the strong nuclear force and the electromagnetic force is a tenuous one. Recall that the attractive strong nuclear force exists between any two nucleons and acts over a very short range while the weaker repulsive electromagnetic force only acts between protons, although over a larger range. Considering the interactions, an imperfect balance between neutrons and protons can result in a nuclear reaction, with the result of regaining equilibrium. Comparing the Electromagnetic and Strong Forces Range of Force Direction Nucleon Interaction Magnitude of Force Electromagnetic Force Long range, though decreasing by 1/r2 Repulsive Proton –proton repulsion Relatively small Strong Nuclear Force Very short range, essentially zero at 1 femtometer Attractive Attraction between any two nucleons 100 times greater than the electromagnetic force The radiation discovered by Becquerel was due to the large number of protons present in his uranium-rich pitchblende. In short, the large number of protons caused the electromagnetic force to be greater than the strong nuclear force. To regain stability, the nucleus needed to undergo a nuclear reaction called alpha (α) decay. The Three Types of RadiationRadioactivity refers to the act of emitting particles or energy from the nucleus. When the uranium nucleus emits energetic nucleons in Becquerel’s experiment, the radioactive process causes the nucleus to alter in structure. The alteration is called radioactive decay. Any substance that undergoes radioactive decay is said to be radioactive. That those terms share a root with the term radiation should not be too surprising, as they all relate to the transmission of energy. Teacher Support Students have plenty of preconceptions about radioactivity. Discuss their preconceptions. Are their concerns related to the radioactive decay process or to the energy transmitted in the process? Radioactivity can be understood as a tendency for a nucleus to reach equilibrium. Discuss with students other instances of objects desiring equilibrium. Such macroscopic interactions may help to make their understanding of radioactivity more tangible. Alpha Decay Alpha decay refers to the type of decay that takes place when too many protons exist in the nucleus. It is the most common type of decay and causes the nucleus to regain equilibrium between its two competing internal forces. During alpha decay, the nucleus ejects two protons and two neutrons, allowing the strong nuclear force to regain balance with the repulsive electromagnetic force. The nuclear equation for an alpha decay process can be shown as follows. X Z A N → Y Z−2 A−4 N + H 2 4 e A nucleus undergoes alpha decay. The alpha particle can be seen as made up of two neutrons and two protons, which constitute a helium-4 atom. Three things to note as a result of the above equation: By ejecting an alpha particle, the original nuclide decreases in atomic number. That means that Becquerel’s uranium nucleus, upon decaying, is actually transformed into thorium, two atomic numbers lower on the periodic table! The process of changing elemental composition is called transmutation. Note that the two protons and two neutrons ejected from the nucleus combine to form a helium nucleus. Shortly after decay, the ejected helium ion typically acquires two electrons to become a stable helium atom. Finally, it is important to see that, despite the elemental change, physical conservation still takes place. The mass number of the new element and the alpha particle together equal the mass number of the original element. Also, the net charge of all particles involved remains the same before and after the transmutation. Teacher Support Differentiate between ionization and transmutation to reinforce that alpha radiation is an elemental change. Beta Decay Like alpha decay, beta ( β ) decay also takes place when there is an imbalance between neutrons and protons within the nucleus. For beta decay, however, a neutron is transformed into a proton and electron or vice versa. The transformation allows for the total mass number of the atom to remain the same, although the atomic number will increase by one (or decrease by one). Once again, the transformation of the neutron allows for a rebalancing of the strong nuclear and electromagnetic forces. The nuclear equation for a beta decay process is shown below. Z A X N → Z+1 A Y N−1 +e+v The symbol v in the equation above stands for a high-energy particle called the neutrino. A nucleus may also emit a positron, and in that case Z decreases and N increases. It is beyond the scope of this section and will be discussed in further detail in the chapter on particles. It is worth noting, however, that the mass number and charge in all beta-decay reactions are conserved. A nucleus undergoes beta decay. The neutron splits into a proton, electron, and neutrino. This particular decay is called β − decay. Teacher Support [AL]The mass number of the nucleus is conserved, but is the mass? Mention that that mass of a proton is slightly less than the mass of the neutron. Have students consider where that mass goes. Note—Not all of it goes to the electron. Gamma Decay Gamma decay is a unique form of radiation that does not involve balancing forces within the nucleus. Gamma decay occurs when a nucleus drops from an excited state to the ground state. Recall that such a change in energy state will release energy from the nucleus in the form of a photon. The energy associated with the photon emitted is so great that its wavelength is shorter than that of an X-ray. Its nuclear equation is as follows. Z A X N → X N +γ A nucleus undergoes gamma decay. The nucleus drops in energy state, releasing a gamma ray. Teacher Support [OL][AL]To differentiate between the three types of decay, you can have the students construct a large Venn diagram of their radioactive properties. For students struggling with the idea, it may be easier to have them first construct a table of what they know about each type of decay. Creating a Decay Equation Write the complete decay equation in Z A X N notation for beta decay producing 137 Ba . Refer to the periodic table for values of Z. Strategy Beta decay results in an increase in atomic number. As a result, the original (or parent) nucleus, must have an atomic number of one fewer proton. Solution The equation for beta decay is as follows X Z A N → Y Z+1 A N−1 +e+v . Considering that barium is the product (or daughter) nucleus and has an atomic number of 56, the original nucleus must be of an atomic number of 55. That corresponds to cesium, or Cs. C 55 137 s N → B 56 137 a N−1 +e+v The number of neutrons in the parent cesium and daughter barium can be determined by subtracting the atomic number from the mass number (137 – 55 for cesium, 137 – 56 for barium). Substitute those values for the N and N – 1 subscripts in the above equation. C 55 137 s 82 → B 56 137 a 81 +e+v Discussion The terms parent and daughter nucleus refer to the reactants and products of a nuclear reaction. The terminology is not just used in this example, but in all nuclear reaction examples. The cesium-137 nuclear reaction poses a significant health risk, as its chemistry is similar to that of potassium and sodium, and so it can easily be concentrated in your cells if ingested. Alpha Decay Energy Found from Nuclear Masses Find the energy emitted in the α decay of 239Pu. Strategy Nuclear reaction energy, such as released in α decay, can be found using the equation E=m c 2 . We must first find Δm , the difference in mass between the parent nucleus and the products of the decay. The mass of pertinent particles is as follows 239Pu: 239.052157 u 235U: 235.043924 u 4He: 4.002602 u. Solution The decay equation for 239Pu is P 239 u→ U 235 + H 4 e . Determine the amount of mass lost between the parent and daughter nuclei. Δm=m( 239 Pu )−( m( 239 U )+m( 4 He ) ) Δm=239.052157u−(235.043924u+4.002602u) Δm=0.0005631u Now we can find E by entering Δm into the equation. E=( Δm ) c 2 =( 0.005631u ) c 2 And knowing that 1u=931.5meV/ c 2 , we can find that E=( 0.005631 )( 931.5MeV/ c 2 )( c 2 )=5.25MeV . Discussion The energy released in this α decay is in the MeV range, about 106 times as great as typical chemical reaction energies, consistent with previous discussions. Most of the energy becomes kinetic energy of the α particle (or 4He nucleus), which moves away at high speed. The energy carried away by the recoil of the 235U nucleus is much smaller, in order to conserve momentum. The 235U nucleus can be left in an excited state to later emit photons ( γ rays). The decay is spontaneous and releases energy, because the products have less mass than the parent nucleus. Properties of RadiationThe charges of the three radiated particles differ. Alpha particles, with two protons, carry a net charge of +2. Beta particles, with one electron, carry a net charge of –1. Meanwhile, gamma rays are solely photons, or light, and carry no charge. The difference in charge plays an important role in how the three radiations affect surrounding substances. Teacher Support [OL][AL]Show table 22.3 to students after they read the preceding paragraph. See if they can explain the penetration distances based on charge difference alone. [BL]-See if students can come up with a relationship between penetration distance and particle charge. If there were a radiation particle with a charge of –4, what would you expect its penetration distance to be? Alpha particles, being highly charged, will quickly interact with ions in the air and electrons within metals. As a result, they have a short range and short penetrating distance in most materials. Beta particles, being slightly less charged, have a larger range and larger penetrating distance. Gamma rays, on the other hand, have little electric interaction with particles and travel much farther. Two diagrams below show the importance of difference in penetration. shows the distance of radiation penetration, and shows the influence various factors have on radiation penetration distance. Comparing Ranges of Radioactive Decay Type of Radiation Range α particles A sheet of paper, a few cm of air, fractions of a millimeter of tissue β particles A thin aluminum plate, tens of cm of tissue γ rays Several cm of lead, meters of concrete The penetration or range of radiation depends on its energy, the material it encounters, and the type of radiation. (a) Greater energy means greater range. (b) Radiation has a smaller range in materials with high electron density. (c) Alphas have the smallest range, betas have a greater range, and gammas have the greatest range. Radiation Detectors The first direct detection of radiation was Becquerel’s darkened photographic plate. Photographic film is still the most common detector of ionizing radiation, being used routinely in medical and dental X-rays. Nuclear radiation can also be captured on film, as seen in . The mechanism for film exposure by radiation is similar to that by photons. A quantum of energy from a radioactive particle interacts with the emulsion and alters it chemically, thus exposing the film. Provided the radiation has more than the few eV of energy needed to induce the chemical change, the chemical alteration will occur. The amount of film darkening is related to the type of radiation and amount of exposure. The process is not 100 percent efficient, since not all incident radiation interacts and not all interactions produce the chemical change. Film badges contain film similar to that used in this dental X-ray film. It is sandwiched between various absorbers to determine the penetrating ability of the radiation as well as the amount. Film badges are worn to determine radiation exposure. (credit: Werneuchen, Wikimedia Commons) Another very common radiation detector is the Geiger tube. The clicking and buzzing sound we hear in dramatizations and documentaries, as well as in our own physics labs, is usually an audio output of events detected by a Geiger counter. These relatively inexpensive radiation detectors are based on the simple and sturdy Geiger tube, shown schematically in . A conducting cylinder with a wire along its axis is filled with an insulating gas so that a voltage applied between the cylinder and wire produces almost no current. Ionizing radiation passing through the tube produces free ion pairs that are attracted to the wire and cylinder, forming a current that is detected as a count. Not every particle is detected, since some radiation can pass through without producing enough ionization. However, Geiger counters are very useful in producing a prompt output that reveals the existence and relative intensity of ionizing radiation. (a) Geiger counters such as this one are used for prompt monitoring of radiation levels, generally giving only relative intensity and not identifying the type or energy of the radiation. (credit: Tim Vickers, Wikimedia Commons) (b) Voltage applied between the cylinder and wire in a Geiger tube affects ions and electrons produced by radiation passing through the gas-filled cylinder. Ions move toward the cylinder and electrons toward the wire. The resulting current is detected and registered as a count. Another radiation detection method records light produced when radiation interacts with materials. The energy of the radiation is sufficient to excite atoms in a material that may fluoresce, such as the phosphor used by Rutherford’s group. Materials called scintillators use a more complex process to convert radiation energy into light. Scintillators may be liquid or solid, and they can be very efficient. Their light output can provide information about the energy, charge, and type of radiation. Scintillator light flashes are very brief in duration, allowing the detection of a huge number of particles in short periods of time. Scintillation detectors are used in a variety of research and diagnostic applications. Among those are the detection of the radiation from distant galaxies using satellite-mounted equipment and the detection of exotic particles in accelerator laboratories. Beta Decay Watch beta decay occur for a collection of nuclei or for an individual nucleus. With this applet, individuals or groups of students can compare half-lives! Check Your Understanding Section Summary The structure of the nucleus is defined by its two nucleons, the neutron and proton. Atomic numbers and mass numbers are used to differentiate between various atoms and isotopes. Those numbers can be combined into an easily recognizable form called a nuclide. The size and stability of the nucleus is based upon two forces: the electromagnetic force and strong nuclear force. Radioactive decay is the alteration of the nucleus through the emission of particles or energy. Alpha decay occurs when too many protons exist in the nucleus. It results in the ejection of an alpha particle, as described in the equation X Z A N → Y Z−2 A−4 N + H 2 4 e . Beta decay occurs when too many neutrons (or protons) exist in the nucleus. It results in the transmutation of a neutron into a proton, electron, and neutrino. The decay is expressed through the equation X Z A N → Y Z+1 A N−1 +e+v . (Beta decay may also transform a proton into a neutron.) Gamma decay occurs when a nucleus in an excited state move to a more stable state, resulting in the release of a photon. Gamma decay is represented with the equation X Z A N → X N +γ . The penetration distance of radiation depends on its energy, charge, and type of material it encounters.

Section Key Terms activity becquerel carbon-14 dating decay constant half-life radioactive dating Half-Life and the Rate of Radioactive Decay Unstable nuclei decay. However, some nuclides decay faster than others. For example, radium and polonium, discovered by Marie and Pierre Curie, decay faster than uranium. That means they have shorter lifetimes, producing a greater rate of decay. Here we will explore half-life and activity, the quantitative terms for lifetime and rate of decay. Why do we use the term like half-life rather than lifetime? The answer can be found by examining , which shows how the number of radioactive nuclei in a sample decreases with time. The time in which half of the original number of nuclei decay is defined as the half-life, t 1 2 . After one half-life passes, half of the remaining nuclei will decay in the next half-life. Then, half of that amount in turn decays in the following half-life. Therefore, the number of radioactive nuclei decreases from N to N / 2 in one half-life, to N / 4 in the next, to N / 8 in the next, and so on. Nuclear decay is an example of a purely statistical process. A more precise definition of half-life is that each nucleus has a 50 percent chance of surviving for a time equal to one half-life. If an individual nucleus survives through that time, it still has a 50 percent chance of surviving through another half-life. Even if it happens to survive hundreds of half-lives, it still has a 50 percent chance of surviving through one more. Therefore, the decay of a nucleus is like random coin flipping. The chance of heads is 50 percent, no matter what has happened before. The probability concept aligns with the traditional definition of half-life. Provided the number of nuclei is reasonably large, half of the original nuclei should decay during one half-life period. Teacher Support [BL]Prepare a few other examples of exponential decay so that students understand the concept of half-life. Atmospheric pressure above sea level or temperature difference between objects, for example, both show exponential decay. Show two different rates of decay for the same scenario so that students have another example of activity. Radioactive decay reduces the number of radioactive nuclei over time. In one half-life ( t 1 2 ), the number decreases to half of its original value. Half of what remains decays in the next half-life, and half of that in the next, and so on. This is exponential decay, as seen in the graph of the number of nuclei present as a function of time. The following equation gives the quantitative relationship between the original number of nuclei present at time zero ( N O ) and the number ( N ) at a later time t N= N O e −λt , where e = 2.71828... is the base of the natural logarithm, and λ is the decay constant for the nuclide. The shorter the half-life, the larger is the value of λ , and the faster the exponential e −λt decreases with time. The decay constant can be found with the equation λ= ln(2) t 1/2 ≈ 0.693 t 1/2 . Activity, the Rate of Decay What do we mean when we say a source is highly radioactive? Generally, it means the number of decays per unit time is very high. We define activity R to be the rate of decay expressed in decays per unit time. In equation form, this is R= ΔN Δt , where ΔN is the number of decays that occur in time Δt . Activity can also be determined through the equation R=λN, which shows that as the amount of radiative material (N) decreases, the rate of decay decreases as well. The SI unit for activity is one decay per second and it is given the name becquerel (Bq) in honor of the discoverer of radioactivity. That is, 1 Bq = 1 decay/second. Activity R is often expressed in other units, such as decays per minute or decays per year. One of the most common units for activity is the curie (Ci), defined to be the activity of 1 g of 226Ra, in honor of Marie Curie’s work with radium. The definition of the curie is 1 Ci = 3.70× 10 10 Bq, or 3.70× 10 10 decays per second. Radiometric Dating Teacher Support [AL]Show that carbon-14 can create nitrogen-14 when struck by neutrino in the atmosphere. Radioactive dating or radiometric dating is a clever use of naturally occurring radioactivity. Its most familiar application is carbon-14 dating. Carbon-14 is an isotope of carbon that is produced when solar neutrinos strike 14 N particles within the atmosphere. Radioactive carbon has the same chemistry as stable carbon, and so it mixes into the biosphere, where it is consumed and becomes part of every living organism. Carbon-14 has an abundance of 1.3 parts per trillion of normal carbon, so if you know the number of carbon nuclei in an object (perhaps determined by mass and Avogadro’s number), you can multiply that number by 1.3× 10 −12 to find the number of 14 C nuclei within the object. Over time, carbon-14 will naturally decay back to 14 N with a half-life of 5,730 years (note that this is an example of beta decay). When an organism dies, carbon exchange with the environment ceases, and 14 C is not replenished. By comparing the abundance of 14 C in an artifact, such as mummy wrappings, with the normal abundance in living tissue, it is possible to determine the artifact’s age (or time since death). Carbon-14 dating can be used for biological tissues as old as 50 or 60 thousand years, but is most accurate for younger samples, since the abundance of 14 C nuclei in them is greater. One of the most famous cases of carbon-14 dating involves the Shroud of Turin, a long piece of fabric purported to be the burial shroud of Jesus (see ). This relic was first displayed in Turin in 1354 and was denounced as a fraud at that time by a French bishop. Its remarkable negative imprint of an apparently crucified body resembles the then-accepted image of Jesus. As a result, the relic has been remained controversial throughout the centuries. Carbon-14 dating was not performed on the shroud until 1988, when the process had been refined to the point where only a small amount of material needed to be destroyed. Samples were tested at three independent laboratories, each being given four pieces of cloth, with only one unidentified piece from the shroud, to avoid prejudice. All three laboratories found samples of the shroud contain 92 percent of the 14 C found in living tissues, allowing the shroud to be dated (see ). Part of the Shroud of Turin, which shows a remarkable negative imprint likeness of Jesus complete with evidence of crucifixion wounds. The shroud first surfaced in the 14th century and was only recently carbon-14 dated. It has not been determined how the image was placed on the material. (credit: Butko, Wikimedia Commons) Carbon-11 Decay Carbon-11 has a half-life of 20.334 min. (a) What is the decay constant for carbon-11? If 1 kg of carbon-11 sample exists at the beginning of an hour, (b) how much material will remain at the end of the hour and (c) what will be the decay activity at that time? Strategy Since N O refers to the amount of carbon-11 at the start, then after one half-life, the amount of carbon-11 remaining will be N O /2. The decay constant is equivalent to the probability that a nucleus will decay each second. As a result, the half-life will need to be converted to seconds. Solution (a) N= N O e −λt Since half of the carbon-11 remains after one half-life, N/ N O =0.5 . 0.5= e −λt Take the natural logarithm of each side to isolate the decay constant. ln( 0.5 )=−λt Convert the 20.334 min to seconds. −0.693=(−λ)(20.334 min)( 60s 1 min ) −0.693=(−λ)(1,220.04s) −0.693 1,220.04s =−λ λ=5.68× 10 −4 s −1 (b) The amount of material after one hour can be found by using the equation N= N O e −λt , with t converted into seconds and NO written as 1,000 g N=(1,000 g)e−(0.000568)(60.60) N=129.4g (c) The decay activity after one hour can be found by using the equation R=λN for the mass value after one hour. R=λN=( 0.000568 decays second )( 129.4grams )=0.0735Bq Discussion (a) The decay constant shows that 0.0568 percent of the nuclei in a carbon-11 sample will decay each second. Another way of considering the decay constant is that a given carbon-11 nuclei has a 0.0568 percent probability of decaying each second. The decay of carbon-11 allows it to be used in positron emission topography (PET) scans; however, its 20.334 min half-life does pose challenges for its administration. (b) One hour is nearly three full half-lives of the carbon-11 nucleus. As a result, one would expect the amount of sample remaining to be approximately one eighth of the original amount. The 129.4 g remaining is just a bit larger than one-eighth, which is sensible given a half-life of just over 20 min.(c) Label analysis shows that the unit of Becquerel is sensible, as there are 0.0735 g of carbon-11 decaying each second. That is smaller amount than at the beginning of the hour, when R=( 0.000568 decay s )( 1,000g )=0.568 g of carbon-11 were decaying each second. How Old is the Shroud of Turin? Calculate the age of the Shroud of Turin given that the amount of 14 C found in it is 92 percent of that in living tissue. Strategy Because 92 percent of the 14 C remains, N/ N O =0.92 . Therefore, the equation N= N O e −λt can be used to find λt . We also know that the half-life of 14 C is 5,730 years, and so once λt is known, we can find λ and then find t as requested. Here, we assume that the decrease in 14 C is solely due to nuclear decay. Solution Solving the equation N= N O e −λt for N/ N O gives N N O = e −λt . Thus, 0.92= e −λt . Taking the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation yields ln0.92=−λt so that −0.0834=−λt. Rearranging to isolate t gives t= 0.0834 λ . Now, the equation λ= 0.693 t 1/2 can be used to find λ for 14 C . Solving for λ and substituting the known half-life gives λ= 0.693 t 1/2 = 0.693 5,730years =1.21× 10 −4 y −1 . We enter that value into the previous equation to find t. t= 0.0834 1.21× 10 −4 =690years. Discussion This dates the material in the shroud to 1988–690 = 1300. Our calculation is only accurate to two digits, so that the year is rounded to 1300. The values obtained at the three independent laboratories gave a weighted average date of 1320 ± 60. That uncertainty is typical of carbon-14 dating and is due to the small amount of 14 C in living tissues, the amount of material available, and experimental uncertainties (reduced by having three independent measurements). That said, is it notable that the carbon-14 date is consistent with the first record of the shroud’s existence and certainly inconsistent with the period in which Jesus lived. There are other noncarbon forms of radioactive dating. Rocks, for example, can sometimes be dated based on the decay of 238 U. The decay series for 238 U ends with 206 Pb , so the ratio of those nuclides in a rock can be used an indication of how long it has been since the rock solidified. Knowledge of the 238 U half-life has shown, for example, that the oldest rocks on Earth solidified about 3.5 × 10 9 years ago. Radioactive Dating Game Learn about different types of radiometric dating, such as carbon dating. Understand how decay and half-life work to enable radiometric dating to work. Play a game that tests your ability to match the percentage of the dating element that remains to the age of the object. Section Summary Radioactive half-life is the time it takes a sample of nuclei to decay to half of its original amount. The rate of radioactive decay is defined as the sample’s activity, represented by the equation R= ΔN Δt . Knowing the half-life of a radioactive isotope allows for the process of radioactive dating to determine the age of a material. If the half-life of a material is known, the age of the material can be found using the equation N= N O e −λt . The age of organic material can be determined using the decay of the carbon-14 isotope, while the age of rocks can be determined using the decay of uranium-238. Key Equations radioactive half-life N= N O e −λt Critical Thinking Provide an example of something that decreases in a manner similar to radioactive decay.

Why is it wrong to presume that the sample will take just 20 seconds to fully decay? The decay constant varies with the mass of the sample. The decay constant results vary with the amount of the sample. The decay constant represents a percentage of the sample that cannot decay. The decay constant represents only the fraction of a sample that decays in a unit of time, not the decay of the entire sample.

The student knows simple examples of atomic, nuclear, and quantum phenomena. The student is expected to: (C) describe the significance of mass-energy equivalence and apply it in explanations of phenomena such as nuclear stability, fission, and fusion. Section Key Terms chain reaction critical mass liquid drop model nuclear fission nuclear fusion proton-proton cycle The previous section dealt with naturally occurring nuclear decay. Without human intervention, some nuclei will change composition in order to achieve a stable equilibrium. This section delves into a less-natural process. Knowing that energy can be emitted in various forms of nuclear change, is it possible to create a nuclear reaction through our own intervention? The answer to this question is yes. Through two distinct methods, humankind has discovered multiple ways of manipulating the atom to release its internal energy. Nuclear Fission In simplest terms, nuclear fission is the splitting of an atomic bond. Given that it requires great energy separate two nucleons, it may come as a surprise to learn that splitting a nucleus can release vast potential energy. And although it is true that huge amounts of energy can be released, considerable effort is needed to do so in practice. An unstable atom will naturally decay, but it may take millions of years to do so. As a result, a physical catalyst is necessary to produce useful energy through nuclear fission. The catalyst typically occurs in the form of a free neutron, projected directly at the nucleus of a high-mass atom. Teacher Support [BL][OL] To ensure understanding, ask students why it is not likely that a stable atom would naturally decay. As shown in , a neutron strike can cause the nucleus to elongate, much like a drop of liquid water. This is why the model is known as the liquid drop model. As the nucleus elongates, nucleons are no longer so tightly packed, and the repulsive electromagnetic force can overcome the short-range strong nuclear force. The imbalance of forces can result in the two ends of the drop flying apart, with some of the nuclear binding energy released to the surroundings. Neutron-induced fission is shown. First, energy is put into a large nucleus when it absorbs a neutron. Acting like a struck liquid drop, the nucleus deforms and begins to narrow in the middle. Since fewer nucleons are in contact, the repulsive Coulomb force is able to break the nucleus into two parts with some neutrons also flying away. As you can imagine, the consequences of the nuclei splitting are substantial. When a nucleus is split, it is not only energy that is released, but a small number of neutrons as well. Those neutrons have the potential to cause further fission in other nuclei, especially if they are directed back toward the other nuclei by a dense shield or neutron reflector (see part (d) of ). Teacher Support [BL][OL][AL]At this point, it is a good idea to show a quick video of a chain reaction model. Good videos of a ping-pong ball dropped into a room full of ping-pong balls and mousetraps elucidate this idea very well and can be easily found online. One such video can be found here. Explain that if the plastic box were not there, the uncontrolled chain reaction would likely not occur. It is analogous to a dense shield or neutron reflector directing neutrons back to interact with more other nuclei and perpetuate the fission chain reaction. However, not every neutron produced by fission induces further fission. Some neutrons escape the fissionable material, while others interact with a nucleus without making it split. We can enhance the number of fissions produced by neutrons by having a large amount of fissionable material as well as a neutron reflector. The minimum amount necessary for self-sustained fission of a given nuclide is called its critical mass. Some nuclides, such as 239Pu, produce more neutrons per fission than others, such as 235U. Additionally, some nuclides are easier to make fission than others. In particular, 235U and 239Pu are easier to fission than the much more abundant 238U. Both factors affect critical mass, which is smallest for 239Pu. The self-sustained fission of nuclei is commonly referred to as a chain reaction, as shown in . A chain reaction can produce self-sustained fission if each fission produces enough neutrons to induce at least one more fission. This depends on several factors, including how many neutrons are produced in an average fission and how easy it is to make a particular type of nuclide fission. A chain reaction can have runaway results. If each atomic split results in two nuclei producing a new fission, the number of nuclear reactions will increase exponentially. One fission will produce two atoms, the next round of fission will create four atoms, the third round eight atoms, and so on. Of course, each time fission occurs, more energy will be emitted, further increasing the power of the atomic reaction. And that is just if two neutrons create fission reactions each round. Perhaps you can now see why so many people consider atomic energy to be an exciting energy source! To make a self-sustained nuclear fission reactor with 235U, it is necessary to slow down the neutrons. Water is very effective at this, since neutrons collide with protons in water molecules and lose energy. shows a schematic of a reactor design called the pressurized water reactor. A pressurized water reactor is cleverly designed to control the fission of large amounts of 235U, while using the heat produced in the fission reaction to create steam for generating electrical energy. Control rods adjust neutron flux so that it is self-sustaining. In case the reactor overheats and boils the water away, the chain reaction terminates, because water is needed to slow down the neutrons. This inherent safety feature can be overwhelmed in extreme circumstances. Control rods containing nuclides that very strongly absorb neutrons are used to adjust neutron flux. To produce large amounts of power, reactors contain hundreds to thousands of critical masses, and the chain reaction easily becomes self-sustaining. Neutron flux must be carefully regulated to avoid an out-of-control exponential increase in the rate of fission. Control rods help prevent overheating, perhaps even a meltdown or explosive disassembly. The water that is used to slow down neutrons, necessary to get them to induce fission in 235U, and achieve criticality, provides a negative feedback for temperature increase. In case the reactor overheats and boils the water to steam or is breached, the absence of water kills the chain reaction. Considerable heat, however, can still be generated by the reactor’s radioactive fission products. Other safety features, thus, need to be incorporated in the event of a loss of coolant accident, including auxiliary cooling water and pumps. Energies in Nuclear Fission The following are two interesting facts to consider: The average fission reaction produces 200 MeV of energy. If you were to measure the mass of the products of a nuclear reaction, you would find that their mass was slightly less than the mass of the original nucleus. How are those things possible? Doesn’t the fission reaction’s production of energy violate the conservation of energy? Furthermore, doesn’t the loss in mass in the reaction violate the conservation of mass? Those are important questions, and they can both be answered with one of the most famous equations in scientific history. E=m c 2 Recall that, according to Einstein’s theory, energy and mass are essentially the same thing. In the case of fission, the mass of the products is less than that of the reactants because the missing mass appears in the form of the energy released in the reaction, with a constant value of c2 Joules of energy converted for each kilogram of material. The value of c2 is substantial—from Einstein’s equation, the amount of energy in just 1 gram of mass would be enough to support the average U.S. citizen for more than 270 years! The example below will show you how a mass-energy transformation of this type takes place. Calculating Energy from a Kilogram of Fissionable Fuel Calculate the amount of energy produced by the fission of 1.00 kg of 235 U , given the average fission reaction of 235 U produces 200 MeV. Strategy The total energy produced is the number of 235 U atoms times the given energy per 235 U fission. We should therefore find the number of 235 U atoms in 1.00 kg. Solution The number of 235 U atoms in 1.00 kg is Avogadro’s number times the number of moles. One mole of 235 U has a mass of 235.04 g; thus, there are ( 1,000g )/( 235.04.00g/mol )=4.25mol . The number of 235 U atoms is therefore ( 4.25mol )( 6.02× 10 23 U/mol )=2.56× 10 24 atoms of 235 U. So the total energy released is E=( 2.56× 10 24 )( 200MeV 235 U )( 1.60× 10 −13 J MeV )=8.21× 10 13 J. Discussion The result is another impressively large amount of energy, equivalent to about 14,000 barrels of crude oil or 600,000 gallons of gasoline. But, it is only one fourth the energy produced by the fusion of a kilogram of a mixture of deuterium and tritium. Even though each fission reaction yields about ten times the energy of a fusion reaction, the energy per kilogram of fission fuel is less, because there are far fewer moles per kilogram of the heavy nuclides. Fission fuel is also much scarcer than fusion fuel, and less than 1 percent of uranium (the 235 U) is readily usable. Nuclear Fission Start a chain reaction, or introduce nonradioactive isotopes to prevent one. Use the applet to control energy production in a nuclear reactor! Nuclear Fusion Nuclear fusion is defined as the combining, or fusing, of two nuclei and, the combining of nuclei also results in an emission of energy. For many, the concept is counterintuitive. After all, if energy is released when a nucleus is split, how can it also be released when nucleons are combined together? The difference between fission and fusion, which results from the size of the nuclei involved, will be addressed next. Teacher Support The reading in this subsection is dense. Prepare your students to tread slowly through this material. Remember that the structure of a nucleus is based on the interplay of the compressive nuclear strong force and the repulsive electromagnetic force. For nuclei that are less massive than iron, the nuclear force is actually stronger than that of the Coulomb force. As a result, when a low-mass nucleus absorbs nucleons, the added neutrons and protons bind the nucleus more tightly. The increased nuclear strong force does work on the nucleus, and energy is released. Once the size of the created nucleus exceeds that of iron, the short-ranging nuclear force does not have the ability to bind a nucleus more tightly, and the emission of energy ceases. In fact, for fusion to occur for elements of greater mass than iron, energy must be added to the system! shows an energy-mass curve commonly used to describe nuclear reactions. Notice the location of iron (Fe) on the graph. All low-mass nuclei to the left of iron release energy through fusion, while all high-mass particles to the right of iron produce energy through fission. Fusion of light nuclei to form medium-mass nuclei converts mass to energy, because binding energy per nucleon ( BE/A ) is greater for the product nuclei. The larger BE/A is, the less mass per nucleon, and so mass is converted to energy and released in such fusion reactions. Just as it is not possible for the elements to the left of iron in the figure to naturally fission, it is not possible for elements to the right of iron to naturally undergo fusion, as that process would require the addition of energy to occur. Furthermore, notice that elements commonly discussed in fission and fusion are elements that can provide the greatest change in binding energy, such as uranium and hydrogen. Iron’s location on the energy-mass curve is important, and explains a number of its characteristics, including its role as an elemental endpoint in fusion reactions in stars. The major obstruction to fusion is the Coulomb repulsion force between nuclei. Since the attractive nuclear force that can fuse nuclei together is short ranged, the repulsion of like positive charges must be overcome in order to get nuclei close enough to induce fusion. shows an approximate graph of the potential energy between two nuclei as a function of the distance between their centers. The graph resembles a hill with a well in its center. A ball rolled to the left must have enough kinetic energy to get over the hump before it falls into the deeper well with a net gain in energy. So it is with fusion. If the nuclei are given enough kinetic energy to overcome the electric potential energy due to repulsion, then they can combine, release energy, and fall into a deep well. One way to accomplish that end is to heat fusion fuel to high temperatures so that the kinetic energy of thermal motion is sufficient to get the nuclei together. Teacher Support For students struggling with the analogy, there is a popular carnival game with a bowling ball, called Roller Bowler, that models the potential energy well affectively. Some of them may find the bowling analogy useful. Potential energy between two light nuclei graphed as a function of distance between them. If the nuclei have enough kinetic energy to get over the Coulomb repulsion hump, they combine, release energy, and drop into a deep attractive well. You might think that, in our Sun, nuclei are constantly coming into contact and fusing. However, this is only partially true. Only at the Sun’s core are the particles close enough and the temperature high enough for fusion to occur! Teacher Support For the following proton-proton cycle, have students check to make sure that mass number and charge are conserved for each of the four equations. For each equation, ask how energy is emitted. It is important to move slowly through this section. Students will likely be unfamiliar with the terms positron and electron neutrino. For now, express the positron as positive electron (not a proton) and the electron neutrino as a massless electron. In the series of reactions below, the Sun produces energy by fusing protons, or hydrogen nuclei ( 1 H , by far the Sun’s most abundant nuclide) into helium nuclei 4 He . The principal sequence of fusion reactions forms what is called the proton-proton cycle 1 H + 1 H → 2 H+ e + + v e ( 0.42 MeV ) 1 H + 2 H → 3 He+γ ( 5.49 MeV ) 3 He + 3 He → 4 He + 1 H + 1 H ( 12.86 MeV ), where e + stands for a positron and v e is an electron neutrino. The energy in parentheses is released by the reaction. Note that the first two reactions must occur twice for the third to be possible, so the cycle consumes six protons ( 1 H ) but gives back two. Furthermore, the two positrons produced will find two electrons and annihilate to form four more γ rays, for a total of six. The overall cycle is thus 2e−+ 4 1 H→4He+2 v e +6γ ( 26.7 MeV ), where the 26.7 MeV includes the annihilation energy of the positrons and electrons and is distributed among all the reaction products. The solar interior is dense, and the reactions occur deep in the Sun where temperatures are highest. It takes about 32,000 years for the energy to diffuse to the surface and radiate away. However, the neutrinos can carry their energy out of the Sun in less than two seconds, because they interact so weakly with other matter. Negative feedback in the Sun acts as a thermostat to regulate the overall energy output. For instance, if the interior of the Sun becomes hotter than normal, the reaction rate increases, producing energy that expands the interior. The expansion cools it and lowers the reaction rate. Conversely, if the interior becomes too cool, it contracts, increasing the temperature and therefore the reaction rate (see ). Stars like the Sun are stable for billions of years, until a significant fraction of their hydrogen has been depleted. Nuclear fusion in the Sun converts hydrogen nuclei into helium; fusion occurs primarily at the boundary of the helium core, where the temperature is highest and sufficient hydrogen remains. Energy released diffuses slowly to the surface, with the exception of neutrinos, which escape immediately. Energy production remains stable because of negative-feedback effects. Nuclear Weapons and Nuclear Power The world was in political turmoil when fission was discovered in 1938. Compounding the troubles, the possibility of a self-sustained chain reaction was immediately recognized by leading scientists the world over. The enormous energy known to be in nuclei, but considered inaccessible, now seemed to be available on a large scale. Within months after the announcement of the discovery of fission, Adolf Hitler banned the export of uranium from newly occupied Czechoslovakia. It seemed that the possible military value of uranium had been recognized in Nazi Germany, and that a serious effort to build a nuclear bomb had begun. Alarmed scientists, many of whom fled Nazi Germany, decided to take action. None was more famous or revered than Einstein. It was felt that his help was needed to get the American government to make a serious effort at constructing nuclear weapons as a matter of survival. Leo Szilard, a Hungarian physicist who had emigrated to America, took a draft of a letter to Einstein, who, although a pacifist, signed the final version. The letter was for President Franklin Roosevelt, warning of the German potential to build extremely powerful bombs of a new type. It was sent in August of 1939, just before the German invasion of Poland that marked the start of World War II. It was not until December 6, 1941, the day before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, that the United States made a massive commitment to building a nuclear bomb. The top secret Manhattan Project was a crash program aimed at beating the Germans. It was carried out in remote locations, such as Los Alamos, New Mexico, whenever possible, and eventually came to cost billions of dollars and employ the efforts of more than 100,000 people. J. Robert Oppenheimer (1904–1967), a talented physicist, was chosen to head the project. The first major step was made by Enrico Fermi and his group in December 1942, when they completed the first self-sustaining nuclear reactor. This first atomic pile, built in a squash court at the University of Chicago, proved that a fission chain reaction was possible. Plutonium was recognized as easier to fission with neutrons and, hence, a superior fission material very early in the Manhattan Project. Plutonium availability was uncertain, and so a uranium bomb was developed simultaneously. shows a gun-type bomb, which takes two subcritical uranium masses and shoots them together. To get an appreciable yield, the critical mass must be held together by the explosive charges inside the cannon barrel for a few microseconds. Since the buildup of the uranium chain reaction is relatively slow, the device to bring the critical mass together can be relatively simple. Owing to the fact that the rate of spontaneous fission is low, a neutron source is at the center the assembled critical mass. A gun-type fission bomb for 235 U utilizes two subcritical masses forced together by explosive charges inside a cannon barrel. The energy yield depends on the amount of uranium and the time it can be held together before it disassembles itself. Plutonium’s special properties necessitated a more sophisticated critical mass assembly, shown schematically in . A spherical mass of plutonium is surrounded by shaped charges (high explosives that focus their blast) that implode the plutonium, crushing it into a smaller volume to form a critical mass. The implosion technique is faster and more effective, because it compresses three-dimensionally rather than one-dimensionally as in the gun-type bomb. Again, a neutron source is included to initiate the chain reaction. An implosion created by high explosives compresses a sphere of 239Pu into a critical mass. The superior fissionability of plutonium has made it the preferred bomb material. Owing to its complexity, the plutonium bomb needed to be tested before there could be any attempt to use it. On July 16, 1945, the test named Trinity was conducted in the isolated Alamogordo Desert in New Mexico, about 200 miles south of Los Alamos (see ). A new age had begun. The yield of the Trinity device was about 10 kilotons (kT), the equivalent of 5,000 of the largest conventional bombs. Trinity test (1945), the first nuclear bomb (credit: U.S. Department of Energy) Although Germany surrendered on May 7, 1945, Japan had been steadfastly refusing to surrender for many months, resulting large numbers of civilian and military casualties. Invasion plans by the Allies estimated a million casualties of their own and untold losses of Japanese lives. The bomb was viewed as a way to end the war. The first bomb used was a gun-type uranium bomb dropped on Hiroshima on August 6 by the United States. Its yield of about 15 kT destroyed the city and killed an estimated 80,000 people, with 100,000 more being seriously injured. The second bomb was an implosion-type plutonium bomb dropped on Nagasaki only three days later. Its 20-kT yield killed at least 50,000 people, something less than Hiroshima because of the hilly terrain and the fact that it was a few kilometers off target. The Japanese were told that one bomb a week would be dropped until they surrendered unconditionally, which they did on August 14. In actuality, the United States had only enough plutonium for one more bomb, as yet unassembled. Teacher Support [BL][OL] [AL]Note that the hydrogen bomb is a fusion bomb, as its energy can only be released by combining multiple hydrogen nuclei together. Knowing that fusion produces several times more energy per kilogram of fuel than fission, some scientists pursued the idea of constructing a fusion bomb. The first such bomb was detonated by the United States several years after the first fission bombs, on October 31, 1952, at Eniwetok Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. It had a yield of 10 megatons (MT), about 670 times that of the fission bomb that destroyed Hiroshima. The Soviet Union followed with a fusion device of its own in August 1953, and a weapons race, beyond the aim of this text to discuss, continued until the end of the Cold War. shows a simple diagram of how a thermonuclear bomb is constructed. A fission bomb is exploded next to fusion fuel in the solid form of lithium deuteride. Before the shock wave blows it apart, γ rays heat and compress the fuel, and neutrons create tritium through the reaction n + 6 Li → 3 H + 4 He . Additional fusion and fission fuels are enclosed in a dense shell of 238 U . At the same time that the uranium shell reflects the neutrons back into the fuel to enhance its fusion, the fast-moving neutrons cause the plentiful and inexpensive 238 U to fission, part of what allows thermonuclear bombs to be so large. This schematic of a fusion bomb (H-bomb) gives some idea of how the 239 Pu fission trigger is used to ignite fusion fuel. Neutrons and γ rays transmit energy to the fusion fuel, create tritium from deuterium, and heat and compress the fusion fuel. The outer shell of 238 U serves to reflect some neutrons back into the fuel, causing more fusion, and it boosts the energy output by fissioning itself when neutron energies become high enough. Of course, not all applications of nuclear physics are as destructive as the weapons described above. Hundreds of nuclear fission power plants around the world attest to the fact that controlled fission is both practical and economical. Given growing concerns over global warming, nuclear power is often seen as a viable alternative to energy derived from fossil fuels. Fusion Reactors For decades, fusion reactors have been deemed the energy of the future. A safer, cleaner, and more abundant potential source of energy than its fission counterpart, images of the fusion reactor have been conjured up each time the need for a renewable, environmentally friendly resource is discussed. Now, after more than half a century of speculating, some scientists believe that fusion reactors are nearly here. In creating energy by combining atomic nuclei, the fusion reaction holds many advantages over fission. First, fusion reactions are more efficient, releasing 3 to 4 times more energy than fission per gram of fuel. Furthermore, unlike fission reactions that require heavy elements like uranium that are difficult to obtain, fusion requires light elements that are abundant in nature. The greatest advantage of the fusion reaction, however, is in its ability to be controlled. While traditional nuclear reactors create worries about meltdowns and radioactive waste, neither is a substantial concern with the fusion reaction. Consider that fusion reactions require a large amount of energy to overcome the repulsive Coulomb force and that the byproducts of a fusion reaction are largely limited to helium nuclei. In order for fusion to occur, hydrogen isotopes of deuterium and tritium must be acquired. While deuterium can easily be gathered from ocean water, tritium is slightly more difficult to come by, though it can be manufactured from Earth’s abundant lithium. Once acquired, the hydrogen isotopes are injected into an empty vessel and subjected to temperature and pressure great enough to mimic the conditions at the core of our Sun. Using carefully controlled high-frequency radio waves, the hydrogen isotopes are broken into plasma and further controlled through an electromagnetic field. As the electromagnetic field continues to exert pressure on the hydrogen plasma, enough energy is supplied to cause the hydrogen plasma to fuse into helium. Tokamak confinement of nuclear fusion plasma. The magnetic field lines are used to confine the high-temperature plasma (purple). Research is currently being done to increase the efficiency of the tokamak confinement model. Once the plasma fuses, high-velocity neutrons are ejected from the newly formed helium atoms. Those high velocity neutrons, carrying the excess energy stored within bonds of the original hydrogen, are able to travel unaffected by the applied magnetic field. In doing so, they strike a barrier around the nuclear reactor, transforming their excess energy to heat. The heat is then harvested to make steam that drives turbines. Hydrogen’s tremendous power is now usable! The historical concern with nuclear fusion reactors is that the energy required to control the electromagnetic field is greater than the energy harvested from the hydrogen atoms. However, recent research by both Lockheed Martin engineers and scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has yielded exciting theoretical improvements in efficiency. At the time of this writing, a test facility called ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) is being constructed in southern France. A joint venture of the European Union, the United States, Japan, Russia, China, South Korea, and India, ITER is designed for further study into the future of nuclear fusion energy production. Section Summary Nuclear fission is the splitting of an atomic bond, releasing a large amount of potential energy previously holding the atom together. The amount of energy released can be determined through the equation E=m c 2 . Nuclear fusion is the combining, or fusing together, of two nuclei. Energy is also released in nuclear fusion as the combined nuclei are closer together, resulting in a decreased strong nuclear force. Fission was used in two nuclear weapons at the conclusion of World War II: the gun-type uranium bomb and the implosion-type plutonium bomb. While fission has been used in both nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors, fusion is capable of releasing more energy per reaction. As a result, fusion is a well-researched, if not yet well-controlled, energy source.

Section Key Terms Anger camera rad radiopharmaceutical therapeutic ratio relative biological effectiveness (RBE) roentgen equivalent man (rem) tagged Medical Applications of Nuclear Physics Applications of nuclear physics have become an integral part of modern life. From the bone scan that detects one cancer to the radioiodine treatment that cures another, nuclear radiation has diagnostic and therapeutic effects on medicine. Medical Imaging A host of medical imaging techniques employ nuclear radiation. What makes nuclear radiation so useful? First, γ radiation can easily penetrate tissue; hence, it is a useful probe to monitor conditions inside the body. Second, nuclear radiation depends on the nuclide and not on the chemical compound it is in, so that a radioactive nuclide can be put into a compound designed for specific purposes. When that is done, the compound is said to be tagged. A tagged compound used for medical purposes is called a radiopharmaceutical. Radiation detectors external to the body can determine the location and concentration of a radiopharmaceutical to yield medically useful information. For example, certain drugs are concentrated in inflamed regions of the body, and their locations can aid diagnosis and treatment as seen in . Another application utilizes a radiopharmaceutical that the body sends to bone cells, particularly those that are most active, to detect cancerous tumors or healing points. Images can then be produced of such bone scans. Clever use of radioisotopes determines the functioning of body organs, such as blood flow, heart muscle activity, and iodine uptake in the thyroid gland. For instance, a radioactive form of iodine can be used to monitor the thyroid, a radioactive thallium salt can be used to follow the blood stream, and radioactive gallium can be used for cancer imaging. Teacher Support [AL]Have students investigate why radioactive iodine, radioactive thallium salt, and radioactive gallium are specifically used for their purposes. A radiopharmaceutical was used to produce this brain image of a patient with Alzheimer’s disease. Certain features are computer enhanced. (credit: National Institutes of Health) Teacher Support Refer students to the explanation of how a scintillator works from earlier in this chapter. Once a radioactive compound has been ingested, a device like that shown in is used to monitor nuclear activity. The device, called an Anger camera or gamma camera uses a piece of lead with holes bored through it. The gamma rays are redirected through the collimator to narrow their beam, and are then interpreted using a device called a scintillator. The computer analysis of detector signals produces an image. One of the disadvantages of this detection method is that there is no depth information (i.e., it provides a two-dimensional view of the tumor as opposed to a three-dimensional view), because radiation from any location under that detector produces a signal. An Anger or gamma camera consists of a lead collimator and an array of detectors. Gamma rays produce light flashes in the scintillators. The light output is converted to an electrical signal by the photomultipliers. A computer constructs an image from the detector output. Single-photon-emission computer tomography (SPECT) used in conjunction with a CT scanner improves on the process carried out by the gamma camera. shows a patient in a circular array of SPECT detectors that may be stationary or rotated, with detector output used by a computer to construct a detailed image. The spatial resolution of this technique is poor, but the three-dimensional image created results in a marked improvement in contrast. SPECT uses a rotating camera to form an image of the concentration of a radiopharmaceutical compound. (credit: Woldo, Wikimedia Commons) Positron emission tomography (or PET) scans utilize images produced by β + emitters. When the emitted positron β+ encounters an electron, mutual annihilation occurs, producing two γ rays. Those γ rays have identical 0.511 MeV energies (the energy comes from the destruction of an electron or positron mass) and they move directly away from each other, allowing detectors to determine their point of origin accurately (as shown in ). It requires detectors on opposite sides to simultaneously (i.e., at the same time) detect photons of 0.511 MeV energy and utilizes computer imaging techniques similar to those in SPECT and CT scans. PET is used extensively for diagnosing brain disorders. It can note decreased metabolism in certain regions that accompany Alzheimer’s disease. PET can also locate regions in the brain that become active when a person carries out specific activities, such as speaking, closing his or her eyes, and so on. A PET system takes advantage of the two identical γ -ray photons produced by positron-electron annihilation. The γ rays are emitted in opposite directions, so that the line along which each pair is emitted is determined. Various events detected by several pairs of detectors are then analyzed by the computer to form an accurate image. Ionizing Radiation on the Body We hear many seemingly contradictory things about the biological effects of ionizing radiation. It can cause cancer, burns, and hair loss, and yet it is used to treat and even cure cancer. How do we understand such effects? Once again, there is an underlying simplicity in nature, even in complicated biological organisms. All the effects of ionizing radiation on biological tissue can be understood by knowing that ionizing radiation affects molecules within cells, particularly DNA molecules. Let us take a brief look at molecules within cells and how cells operate. Cells have long, double-helical DNA molecules containing chemical patterns called genetic codes that govern the function and processes undertaken by the cells. Damage to DNA consists of breaks in chemical bonds or other changes in the structural features of the DNA chain, leading to changes in the genetic code. In human cells, we can have as many as a million individual instances of damage to DNA per cell per day. The repair ability of DNA is vital for maintaining the integrity of the genetic code and for the normal functioning of the entire organism. A cell with a damaged ability to repair DNA, which could have been induced by ionizing radiation, can do one of the following: The cell can go into an irreversible state of dormancy, known as senescence. The cell can commit suicide, known as programmed cell death. The cell can go into unregulated cell division, leading to tumors and cancers. Teacher Support [BL][OL]Why does radiation cause damage to DNA? Have students view the disruption due to the energy that radiation carries. Emphasize that ionizing radiation is just radiation with enough energy to affect the structural makeup of a cell (i.e., to ionize means to effect electrons). Since ionizing radiation damages the DNA, ionizing radiation has its greatest effect on cells that rapidly reproduce, including most types of cancer. Thus, cancer cells are more sensitive to radiation than normal cells and can be killed by it easily. Cancer is characterized by a malfunction of cell reproduction, and can also be caused by ionizing radiation. There is no contradiction to say that ionizing radiation can be both a cure and a cause. Radiotherapy Radiotherapy is effective against cancer because cancer cells reproduce rapidly and, consequently, are more sensitive to radiation. The central problem in radiotherapy is to make the dose for cancer cells as high as possible while limiting the dose for normal cells. The ratio of abnormal cells killed to normal cells killed is called the therapeutic ratio, and all radiotherapy techniques are designed to enhance that ratio. Radiation can be concentrated in cancerous tissue by a number of techniques. One of the most prevalent techniques for well-defined tumors is a geometric technique shown in . A narrow beam of radiation is passed through the patient from a variety of directions with a common crossing point in the tumor. The technique concentrates the dose in the tumor while spreading it out over a large volume of normal tissue. The 60Co source of γ -radiation is rotated around the patient so that the common crossing point is in the tumor, concentrating the dose there. This geometric technique works for well-defined tumors. Another use of radiation therapy is through radiopharmaceuticals. Cleverly, radiopharmaceuticals are used in cancer therapy by tagging antibodies with radioisotopes. Those antibodies are extracted from the patient, cultured, loaded with a radioisotope, and then returned to the patient. The antibodies are then concentrated almost entirely in the tissue they developed to fight, thus localizing the radiation in abnormal tissue. This method is used with radioactive iodine to fight thyroid cancer. While the therapeutic ratio can be quite high for such short-range radiation, there can be a significant dose for organs that eliminate radiopharmaceuticals from the body, such as the liver, kidneys, and bladder. As with most radiotherapy, the technique is limited by the tolerable amount of damage to the normal tissue. Radiation Dosage To quantitatively discuss the biological effects of ionizing radiation, we need a radiation dose unit that is directly related to those effects. To do define such a unit, it is important to consider both the biological organism and the radiation itself. Knowing that the amount of ionization is proportional to the amount of deposited energy, we define a radiation dose unit called the rad. It 1/100 of a joule of ionizing energy deposited per kilogram of tissue, which is 1rad=0.01J/kg. For example, if a 50.0-kg person is exposed to ionizing radiation over her entire body and she absorbs 1.00 J, then her whole-body radiation dose is ( 1.00J )/(50.0kg)=0.0200J/kg=2.00rad. If the same 1.00 J of ionizing energy were absorbed in her 2.00-kg forearm alone, then the dose to the forearm would be ( 1.00J )/(2.00kg)=0.500J/kg=50.0rad, and the unaffected tissue would have a zero rad dose. When calculating radiation doses, you divide the energy absorbed by the mass of affected tissue. You must specify the affected region, such as the whole body or forearm in addition to giving the numerical dose in rads. Although the energy per kilogram in 1 rad is small, it can still have significant effects. Since only a few eV cause ionization, just 0.01 J of ionizing energy can create a huge number of ion pairs and have an effect at the cellular level. The effects of ionizing radiation may be directly proportional to the dose in rads, but they also depend on the type of radiation and the type of tissue. That is, for a given dose in rads, the effects depend on whether the radiation is α , β , γ , X-ray, or some other type of ionizing radiation. The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) relates to the amount of biological damage that can occur from a given type of radiation and is given in for several types of ionizing radiation. Relative Biological Effectiveness Type and energy of radiation RBE X-rays 1 γ rays 1 β rays greater than 32 keV 1 β rays less than 32 keV 1.7 Neutrons, thermal to slow (< 20 keV) 2–5 Neutrons, fast (1–10 MeV) 10 (body), 32 (eyes) Protons (1–10 MeV) 10 (body), 32 (eyes) α rays from radioactive decay 10–20 Heavy ions from accelerators 10–20 The RBEs given in are approximate, but they yield certain valuable insights. The eyes are more sensitive to radiation, because the cells of the lens do not repair themselves. Though both are neutral and have large ranges, neutrons cause more damage than γ rays because neutrons often cause secondary radiation when they are captured. Short-range particles such as α rays have a severely damaging effect to internal anatomy, as their damage is concentrated and more difficult for the biological organism to repair. However, the skin can usually block alpha particles from entering the body. Can you think of any other insights from the table? A final dose unit more closely related to the effect of radiation on biological tissue is called the roentgen equivalent man, or rem. A combination of all factors mentioned previously, the roentgen equivalent man is defined to be the dose in rads multiplied by the relative biological effectiveness. rem=rad×RBE The large-scale effects of radiation on humans can be divided into two categories: immediate effects and long-term effects. gives the immediate effects of whole-body exposures received in less than one day. If the radiation exposure is spread out over more time, greater doses are needed to cause the effects listed. Any dose less than 10 rem is called a low dose, a dose 10 to 100 rem is called a moderate dose, and anything greater than 100 rem is called a high dose. Immediate Effects of Radiation (Adults, Whole Body, Single Exposure) Dose (rem) Effect 0–10 No observable effect 10–100 Slight to moderate decrease in white blood cell counts 50 Temporary sterility 100–200 Significant reduction in blood cell counts, brief nausea, and vomiting; rarely fatal 200–500 Nausea, vomiting, hair loss, severe blood damage, hemorrhage, fatalities 450 LD50/32; lethal to 50% of the population within 32 days after exposure if untreated 500–2,000 Worst effects due to malfunction of small intestine and blood systems; limited survival > 2,000 Fatal within hours due to collapse of central nervous system Health Physicist Are you interested in learning more about radiation? Are you curious about studying radiation dosage levels and ensuring the safety of the environment and people that are most closely affected by it? If so, you may be interested in becoming a health physicist. The field of health physics draws from a variety of science disciplines with the central aim of mitigating radiation concerns. Those that work as health physicists have a diverse array of potential jobs available to them, including those in research, industry, education, environmental protection, and governmental regulation. Furthermore, while the term health physicist may lead many to think of the medical field, there are plenty of applications within the military, industrial, and energy fields as well.As a researcher, a health physicist can further environmental studies on the effects of radiation, design instruments for more accurate measurements, and assist in establishing valuable radiation standards. Within the energy field, a health physicsist often acts as a manager, closely tied to all operations at all levels, from procuring appropirate equipment to monitoring health data. Within industry, the health physicist acts as a consultant, assisting industry management in important decisions, designing facilities, and choosing appropriate detection tools. The health physicist possesses a unique knowledge base that allows him or her to operate in a wide variety of interesting disciplines! To become a health physicist, it is necessary to have a background in the physical sciences. Understanding the fields of biology, physiology, biochemistry, and genetics are all important as well. The ability to analyze and solve new problems is critical, and a natural aptitude for science and mathematics will assist in the continued necessary training. There are two possible certifications for health physicists: from the American Board of Health Physicists (ABHP) and the National Registry of Radiation Protection Technologists (NRRPT). Section Summary Medical imaging occurs when a radiopharmaceutical placed in the body provides information to an array of radiation detectors outside the body. Devices utilizing medical imaging include the Anger camera, SPECT detector, and PET scan. Ionizing radiation can both cure and cause cancer through the manipulation of DNA molecules.

Using the table, explain what you would experience if your yearly dosage of radiation was received all over the course of one day. Also, determine whether your dosage is considered a low, moderate, or high. Using the information input into the webpage, what percentage of your dosage comes from natural sources? The average percentage of radiation from natural sources for an individual is around 85 percent. Research radiation dosages for evacuees from events like the Chernobyl and Fukushima meltdowns. How does your annual radiation exposure rate compare to the net dosage for evacuees of each event. Use numbers to support your answer. The U.S. Department of Labor limits the amount of radiation that a given worker may receive in a 12 month period. Research the present maximum value and compare your annual exposure rate to that of a radiation worker. Use numbers to support your answer. What types of work are likely to cause an increase in the radiation exposure of a particular worker? Provide one question based upon the information gathered on the EPA website. Teacher Support Most evacuees of Chernobyl received radiation doses of less than 50 mSv, although a few received more than 100 mSv. However, radiation doses on the day of the accident exceeded 20,000 mSv, and some workers tasked to clean up the site after the accident had doses greater than 500 mSv. Regarding the Fukushima meltdownNo harmful health effects were found in 195,345 residents living in the vicinity of the plant who were screened by the end of May 2011. All the 1,080 children tested for thyroid gland exposure showed results within safe limits, according to the report submitted to IAEA in June. By December, government health checks of some 1,700 residents who were evacuated from three municipalities showed that two thirds received an external radiation dose within the normal international limit of 1 mSv/yr, 98 percent were below 5 mSv/yr, and ten people were exposed to more than 10 mSv. As regulated by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration, the maximum permissible amount of radiation exposure during a twelve-month period is 5 rem.

(credit: Image Editor, Flickr) Following ideas remarkably similar to those of the ancient Greeks, we continue to look for smaller and smaller structures in nature, hoping ultimately to find and understand the most fundamental building blocks that exist. Atomic physics deals with the smallest units of elements and compounds. In its study, we have found a relatively small number of atoms with systematic properties, and these properties have explained a tremendous range of phenomena. Nuclear physics is concerned with the nuclei of atoms and their substructures. Here, a smaller number of components—the proton and neutron—make up all nuclei. Exploring the systematic behavior of their interactions has revealed even more about matter, forces, and energy. Particle physics deals with the substructures of atoms and nuclei and is particularly aimed at finding those truly fundamental particles that have no further substructure. Just as in atomic and nuclear physics, we have found a complex array of particles and properties with systematic characteristics analogous to the periodic table and the chart of nuclides. An underlying structure is apparent, and there is some reason to think that we are finding particles that have no substructure. Of course, we have been in similar situations before. For example, atoms were once thought to be the ultimate substructures. It is possible that we could continue to find deeper and deeper structures without ever discovering the ultimate substructure—in science there is never complete certainty. See . The properties of matter are based on substructures called molecules and atoms. Each atom has the substructure of a nucleus surrounded by electrons, and their interactions explain atomic properties. Protons and neutrons—and the interactions between them—explain the stability and abundance of elements and form the substructure of nuclei. Protons and neutrons are not fundamental—they are composed of quarks. Like electrons and a few other particles, quarks may be the fundamental building blocks of all matter, lacking any further substructure. But the story is not complete because quarks and electrons may have substructures smaller than details that are presently observable. A solid, a molecule, an atom, a nucleus, a nucleon (a particle that makes up the nucleus—either a proton or a neutron), and a quark. This chapter covers the basics of particle physics as we know it today. An amazing convergence of topics is evolving in particle physics.

The student knows the nature of forces in the physical world. The student is expected to: (H) describe evidence for and effects of the strong and weak nuclear forces in nature. Section Key Terms carrier particle colliding beam cyclotron Feynman diagram graviton particle physics pion quantum electrodynamics synchrotron W − boson W + boson weak nuclear force Z 0 boson Teacher Support Prior to the section, have students create a list of different forces. Additionally, it may be valuable to review gravitational and electric fields, Rutherford’s gold foil experiment, the Van de Graaff generator, particle decay, and the impulse—momentum theorem. Despite the apparent complexity within the universe, there remain just four basic forces. These forces are responsible for all interactions known to science: from the very small to the very large to those that we experience in our day-to-day lives. These forces describe the movement of galaxies, the chemical reactions in our laboratories, the structure within atomic nuclei, and the cause of radioactive decay. They describe the true cause behind familiar terms like friction and the normal force. These four basic forces are known as fundamental because they alone are responsible for all observations of forces in nature. The four fundamental forces are gravity, electromagnetism, weak nuclear force, and strong nuclear force. Teacher Support Some students may be disheartened by the idea that two of the four fundamental forces have barely been discussed in the course. Remind them that nearly all of their daily observations and interactions are due to the gravitational and electromagnetic forces and that this chapter will not be un-teaching their prior lessons. Discussions of the strong and weak nuclear forces are designed to help them understand particle organization and particle decay. Prior to beginning the lesson, have students predict the relative strengths of the four forces, from weakest to strongest. Refer to their rankings as you present the section. Later, this will be a useful tool to discuss why the weak force isn’t the weakest force and should provide students a greater appreciation for the discovery of science. Understanding the Four Forces The gravitational force is most familiar to us because it describes so many of our common observations. It explains why a dropped ball falls to the ground and why our planet orbits the Sun. It gives us the property of weight and determines much about the motion of objects in our daily lives. Because gravitational force acts between all objects of mass and has the ability to act over large distances, the gravitational force can be used to explain much of what we observe and can even describe the motion of objects on astronomical scales! That said, gravity is incredibly weak compared to the other fundamental forces and is the weakest of all of the fundamental forces. Consider this: The entire mass of Earth is needed to hold an iron nail to the ground. Yet with a simple magnet, the force of gravity can be overcome, allowing the nail to accelerate upward through space. Teacher Support A brief nail-magnet demonstration as described above is a powerful way to help students recognize the weakness of gravity. Discussion can follow regarding why people tend to feel that gravity is a strong force, what would happen if a charged object the size of Earth existed, and so forth. The electromagnetic force is responsible for both electrostatic interactions and the magnetic force seen between bar magnets. When focusing on the electrostatic relationship between two charged particles, the electromagnetic force is known as the coulomb force. The electromagnetic force is an important force in the chemical and biological sciences, as it is responsible for molecular connections like ionic bonding and hydrogen bonding. Additionally, the electromagnetic force is behind the common physics forces of friction and the normal force. Like the gravitational force, the electromagnetic force is an inverse square law. However, the electromagnetic force does not exist between any two objects of mass, only those that are charged. Teacher Support Take a moment to review forces and chemistry concepts. Look at each from the perspective of the electromagnetic force. Consider terms like the normal force, friction, chemical bonding, surface tension, and capillary action. Allow students to consider the pervasive nature of the electromagnetic force in their daily observations. When considering the structure of an atom, the electromagnetic force is somewhat apparent. After all, the electrons are held in place by an attractive force from the nucleus. But what causes the nucleus to remain intact? After all, if all protons are positive, it makes sense that the coulomb force between the protons would repel the nucleus apart immediately. Scientists theorized that another force must exist within the nucleus to keep it together. They further theorized that this nuclear force must be significantly stronger than gravity, which has been observed and measured for centuries, and also stronger than the electromagnetic force, which would cause the protons to want to accelerate away from each other. The strong nuclear force is an attractive force that exists between all nucleons. This force, which acts equally between proton-proton connections, proton-neutron connections, and neutron-neutron connections, is the strongest of all forces at short ranges. However, at a distance of 1013 cm, or the diameter of a single proton, the force dissipates to zero. If the nucleus is large (it has many nucleons), then the distance between each nucleon could be much larger than the diameter of a single proton. Teacher SupportAt this time, it may be useful to have students construct a table categorizing each for based on important characteristics: attractive or attractive/repulsive force, force strength, force range, and so on. While will help in organization, students will make more sense of the material if they create a table on their own. [OL][AL]To make the strength-distance relationship of the strong force more visible, show students the graph below. Note that repulsion is considered a positive strong force, while attraction is considered a negative strong force. [AL]Ask students what distance aligns with the valley representing the maximum attractive force. NoteThis is equivalent to the average distance between two nucleons. The weak nuclear force is responsible for beta decay, as seen in the equation Z A X N → Z+1 A Y N–1 + e + v. Recall that beta decay is when a beta particle is ejected from an atom. In order to accelerate away from the nucleus, the particle must be acted on by a force. Enrico Fermi was the first to envision this type of force. While this force is appropriately labeled, it remains stronger than the gravitational force. However, its range is even smaller than that of the strong force, as can be seen in . The weak nuclear force is more important than it may appear at this time, as will be addressed when we discuss quarks.Relative strength and range of the four fundamental forces Force Approximate Relative Strength[1] Range [1]Relative strength is based on the strong force felt by a protonproton pair. Gravity 10 −38 ∞ Weak 10 −13 < 10 −18 m Electromagnetic 10 −2 ∞ Strong 1 < 10 −15 m Transmitting the Four Fundamental Forces Teacher Support This subsection may be troubling to students who have a great appreciation for the gravitational field concept. You can reassure these students that the field concept is still used to explain and predict phenomena. Just as it troubled Einstein prior to formulating the gravitational field theory, the concept of forces acting over a distance had greatly troubled particle physicists. That is, how does one proton know that another exists? Furthermore, what causes one proton to make a second proton repel? Or, for that matter, what is it about a proton that causes a neutron to attract? These mysterious interactions were first considered by Hideki Yukawa in 1935 and laid the foundation for much of what we now understand about particle physics. Hideki Yukawa’s focus was on the strong nuclear force and, in particular, its incredibly short range. His idea was a blend of particles, relativity, and quantum mechanics that was applicable to all four forces. Yukawa proposed that the nuclear force is actually transmitted by the exchange of particles, called carrier particles, and that what we commonly refer to as the force’s field consists of these carrier particles. Specifically for the strong nuclear force, Yukawa proposed that a previously unknown particle, called a pion, is exchanged between nucleons, transmitting the force between them. illustrates how a pion would carry a force between a proton and a neutron. The strong nuclear force is transmitted between a proton and neutron by the creation and exchange of a pion. The pion, created through a temporary violation of conservation of mass-energy, travels from the proton to the neutron and is recaptured. It is not directly observable and is called a virtual particle. Note that the proton and neutron change identity in the process. The range of the force is limited by the fact that the pion can exist for only the short time allowed by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Yukawa used the finite range of the strong nuclear force to estimate the mass of the pion; the shorter the range, the larger the mass of the carrier particle. In Yukawa’s strong force, the carrier particle is assumed to be transmitted at the speed of light and is continually transferred between the two nucleons shown. The particle that Yukawa predicted was finally discovered within cosmic rays in 1947. Its name, the pion, stands for pi meson, where meson means medium mass; it’s a medium mass because it is smaller than a nucleon but larger than an electron. Yukawa launched the field that is now called quantum chromodynamics, and the carrier particles are now called gluons due to their strong binding power. The reason for the change in the particle name will be explained when quarks are discussed later in this section. As you may assume, the strong force is not the only force with a carrier particle. Nuclear decay from the weak force also requires a particle transfer. In the weak force are the following three: the weak negative carrier, W–; the weak positive carrier, W+; and the zero charge carrier, Z0. As we will see, Fermi inferred that these particles must carry mass, as the total mass of the products of nuclear decay is slightly larger than the total mass of all reactants after nuclear decay. The carrier particle for the electromagnetic force is, not surprisingly, the photon. After all, just as a lightbulb can emit photons from a charged tungsten filament, the photon can be used to transfer information from one electrically charged particle to another. Finally, the graviton is the proposed carrier particle for gravity. While it has not yet been found, scientists are currently looking for evidence of its existence (see Boundless Physics: Searching for the Graviton). Teacher Support [BL][OL]The concept of a carrier particle transmitting a force is similar to the concept of using energy to transmit information. How do you let your friend know that you are at school? Do you send a text message? Wave to them at their locker? Shout down the hallway? In each case, waves transfer energy from you to your friend. In the same manner, carrier particles are necessary to carry the weak nuclear force. So how does a carrier particle transmit a fundamental force? shows a virtual photon transmitted from one positively charged particle to another. The transmitted photon is referred to as a virtual particle because it cannot be directly observed while transmitting the force. shows a way of graphing the exchange of a virtual photon between the two positively charged particles. This graph of time versus position is called a Feynman diagram, after the brilliant American physicist Richard Feynman (1918–1988), who developed it. The image in part (a) shows the exchange of a virtual photon transmitting the electromagnetic force between charges, just as virtual pion exchange carries the strong nuclear force between nucleons. The image in part (b) shows that the photon cannot be directly observed in its passage because this would disrupt it and alter the force. In this case, the photon does not reach the other charge. Teacher Support The term virtual particle actually refers to a disturbance in space created by the presence of the two nucleons. Use of the term virtual hints at the idea that the carrier particle should not be confused with a regular particle of mass. A full understanding of the true nature of virtual particles, however, relies on mathematics and theory beyond the scope of this text. The Feynman diagram should be read from the bottom up to show the movement of particles over time. In it, you can see that the left proton is propelled leftward from the photon emission, while the right proton feels an impulse to the right when the photon is received. In addition to the Feynman diagram, Richard Feynman was one of the theorists who developed the field of quantum electrodynamics (QED), which further describes electromagnetic interactions on the submicroscopic scale. For this work, he shared the 1965 Nobel Prize with Julian Schwinger and S.I. Tomonaga. A Feynman diagram explaining the strong force interaction hypothesized by Yukawa can be seen in . Here, you can see the change in particle type due to the exchange of the pi meson. Teacher Support [BL][OL][AL]To help students explain the Feynman diagram, ask a number of specific questions. In what direction is the left proton traveling? What happens to it when it releases a virtual photon? In what direction does the virtual photon travel? Is the photon received by the right proton at the same time as it is emitted? What effect does the photon have on the right proton’s trajectory? The Feynman diagram for the exchange of a virtual photon between two positively charged particles illustrates how electromagnetic force is transmitted on a quantum mechanical scale. Time is graphed vertically, while the distance is graphed horizontally. The two positively charged particles are seen to repel each other by the photon exchange. The image shows a Feynman diagram for the exchange of a π+ (pion) between a proton and a neutron, carrying the strong nuclear force between them. This diagram represents the situation shown more pictorially in . The relative masses of the listed carrier particles describe something valuable about the four fundamental forces, as can be seen in . W bosons (consisting of W − and W + bosons) and Z bosons ( Z 0 bosons), carriers of the weak nuclear force, are nearly 1,000 times more massive than pions, carriers of the strong nuclear force. Simultaneously, the distance that the weak nuclear force can be transmitted is approximately 1 1,000 times the strong force transmission distance. Unlike carrier particles, which have a limited range, the photon is a massless particle that has no limit to the transmission distance of the electromagnetic force. This relationship leads scientists to understand that the yet-unfound graviton is likely massless as well.Carrier particles and their relative masses compared to pions for the four fundamental forces Force Carrier Particle Range Relative Strength[1] [1]Relative strength is based on the strong force felt by a proton-proton pair.

Given the discovery of carrier particles during the twentieth century, the importance of understanding gravitation has yet again gained the interest of prominent physicists everywhere. With carrier particles discovered for three of the four fundamental forces, it is sensible to scientists that a similar particle, titled the graviton, must exist for the gravitational force. While evidence of this particle is yet to be uncovered, scientists are working diligently to discover its existence. So what do scientists think about the unfound particle? For starters, the graviton (like the photon) should be a massless particle traveling at the speed of light. This is assumed because, like the electromagnetic force, gravity is an inverse square law, F≈ 1 r 2 . Scientists also theorize that the graviton is an electrically neutral particle, as an empty space within the influence of gravity is chargeless. Teacher Support Understanding why gravitons have a quantum mechanical spin of 2 is not necessary at this time. This information is provided so that students recognize that the graviton has different characteristics from the photon, another massless, chargeless carrier particle. However, because gravity is such a weak force, searching for the graviton has resulted in some unique methods. LIGO, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, is one tool currently being utilized (see ). While searching for a gravitational wave to find a carrier particle may seem counterintuitive, it is similar to the approach taken by Planck and Einstein to learn more about the photon. According to wave-particle duality, if a gravitational wave can be found, the graviton should be present along with it. Predicted by Einstein’s theory of general relativity, scientists have been monitoring binary star systems for evidence of these gravitational waves. In searching for gravitational waves, scientists are using the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Here we see the control room of LIGO in Hanford, Washington. Particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are being used to search for the graviton through high-energy collisions. While scientists at the LHC speculate that the particle may not exist long enough to be seen, evidence of its prior existence, like footprints in the sand, can be found through gaps in projected energy and momentum. Some scientists are even searching the remnants of the Big Bang in an attempt to find the graviton. By observing the cosmic background radiation, they are looking for anomalies in gravitational waves that would provide information about the gravity particles that existed at the start of our universe. Regardless of the method used, scientists should know the graviton once they find it. A massless, chargeless particle with a spin of 2 and traveling at the speed of light—there is no other particle like it. Should it be found, its discovery would surely be considered by future generations to be on par with those of Newton and Einstein. Accelerators Create Matter From EnergyBefore looking at all the particles that make up our universe, let us first examine some of the machines that create them. The fundamental process in creating unknown particles is to accelerate known particles, such as protons or electrons, and direct a beam of them toward a target. Collisions with target nuclei provide a wealth of information, such as information obtained by Rutherford in the gold foil experiment. If the energy of the incoming particles is large enough, new matter can even be created in the collision. The more energy input or ΔE, the more matter m can be created, according to mass energy equivalence m=ΔE/ c 2 . Limitations are placed on what can occur by known conservation laws, such as conservation of mass-energy, momentum, and charge. Even more interesting are the unknown limitations provided by nature. While some expected reactions do occur, others do not, and still other unexpected reactions may appear. New laws are revealed, and the vast majority of what we know about particle physics has come from accelerator laboratories. It is the particle physicist’s favorite indoor sport. Our earliest model of a particle accelerator comes from the Van de Graaff generator. The relatively simple device, which you have likely seen in physics demonstrations, can be manipulated to produce potentials as great as 50 million volts. While these machines do not have energies large enough to produce new particles, analysis of their accelerated ions was instrumental in exploring several aspects of the nucleus.Another equally famous early accelerator is the cyclotron, invented in 1930 by the American physicist, E.O. Lawrence (1901–1958). is a visual representation with more detail. Cyclotrons use fixed-frequency alternating electric fields to accelerate particles. The particles spiral outward in a magnetic field, making increasingly larger radius orbits during acceleration. This clever arrangement allows the successive addition of electric potential energy with each loop. As a result, greater particle energies are possible than in a Van de Graaff generator. Teacher Support [BL][OL][AL]There are two forces acting with the cyclotron in . A centripetal force is created by the magnetic field, which can be verified to the students through use of the right-hand rule. Additionally, the voltage differential creates a linear force at the gap between the two Dees. Note to the students that the voltage gap reverses direction at a constant rate so that the linear force is always in the direction of the particle’s travel. On the left is an artist’s rendition of the popular physics demonstration tool, the Van de Graaff generator. A battery (A) supplies excess positive charge to a pointed conductor, the points of which spray the charge onto a moving insulating belt near the bottom. The pointed conductor (B) on top in the large sphere picks up the charge. (The induced electric field at the points is so large that it removes the charge from the belt.) This can be done because the charge does not remain inside the conducting sphere but moves to its outer surface. An ion source inside the sphere produces positive ions, which are accelerated away from the positive sphere to high velocities. On the right is a cyclotron. Cyclotrons use a magnetic field to cause particles to move in circular orbits. As the particles pass between the plates of the Dees, the voltage across the gap is oscillated to accelerate them twice in each orbit. A synchrotron is a modification of the cyclotron in which particles continually travel in a fixed-radius orbit, increasing speed each time. Accelerating voltages are synchronized with the particles to accelerate them, hence the name. Additionally, magnetic field strength is increased to keep the orbital radius constant as energy increases. A ring of magnets and accelerating tubes, as shown in , are the major components of synchrotrons. High-energy particles require strong magnetic fields to steer them, so superconducting magnets are commonly employed. Still limited by achievable magnetic field strengths, synchrotrons need to be very large at very high energies since the radius of a high-energy particle’s orbit is very large. Teacher Support [BL][OL]Assist the students in constructing a chart or Venn diagram showing similarities and differences between the cyclotron and synchrotron. Consideration should include particle travel, rate of voltage oscillation, and device construction. To further probe the nucleus, physicists need accelerators of greater energy and detectors of shorter wavelength. To do so requires not only greater funding but greater ingenuity as well. Colliding beams used at both the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab; see ) near Chicago and the LHC in Switzerland are designed to reduce energy loss in particle collisions. Typical stationary particle detectors lose a large amount of energy to the recoiling target struck by the accelerating particle. By providing head-on collisions between particles moving in opposite directions, colliding beams make it possible to create particles with momenta and kinetic energies near zero. This allows for particles of greater energy and mass to be created. is a schematic representation of this effect. In addition to circular accelerators, linear accelerators can be used to reduce energy radiation losses. The Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (now called the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory) in California is home to the largest such accelerator in the world. (a) A synchrotron has a ring of magnets and accelerating tubes. The frequency of the accelerating voltages is increased to cause the beam particles to travel the same distance in a shorter time. The magnetic field should also be increased to keep each beam burst traveling in a fixed-radius path. Limits on magnetic field strength require these machines to be very large in order to accelerate particles to very high energies. (b) A positively charged particle is shown in the gap between accelerating tubes. (c) While the particle passes through the tube, the potentials are reversed so that there is another acceleration at the next gap. The frequency of the reversals needs to be varied as the particle is accelerated to achieve successive accelerations in each gap. This schematic shows the two rings of Fermilab’s accelerator and the scheme for colliding protons and antiprotons (not to scale). The Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, near Batavia, Illinois, was a subatomic particle collider that accelerated protons and antiprotons to attain energies up to 1 Tev (a trillion electronvolts). The circular ponds near the rings were built to dissipate waste heat. This accelerator was shut down in September 2011.

LINAC synchrotron SLAC Van de Graaff accelerator Critical Thinking The gravitational force is considered a very weak force. Yet, it is strong enough to hold Earth in orbit around the Sun. Explain this apparent disparity. At the level of the Earth-to-Sun distance, gravity is the strongest acting force because neither the strong nor the weak nuclear force exists at this distance. At the level of the Earth-to-Sun distance, gravity is the strongest acting force because both the strong and the weak nuclear force is minimal at this distance.

Quarks“The first principles of the universe are atoms and empty space. Everything else is merely thought to exist…” “… Further, the atoms are unlimited in size and number, and they are borne along with the whole universe in a vortex, and thereby generate all composite things—fire, water, air, earth. For even these are conglomerations of given atoms. And it because of their solidity that these atoms are impassive and unalterable.” Diogenes Laertius (summarizing the views of Democritus, circa 460–370 B.C.) The search for fundamental particles is nothing new. Atomists of the Greek and Indian empires, like Democritus of fifth century B.C., openly wondered about the most finite components of our universe. Though dormant for centuries, curiosity about the atomic nature of matter was reinvigorated by Rutherford’s gold foil experiment and the discovery of the nucleus. By the early 1930s, scientists believed they had fully determined the tiniest constituents of matter—in the form of the proton, neutron, and electron. Teacher Support [AL]Have interested students read the texts of Democritus and Empedocles to see how atomism was viewed in the Greek era. Have the students compare and contrast these theories to our current scientific model. This would be only partially true. At present, scientists know that there are hundreds of particles not unlike our electron and nucleons, all making up what some have termed the particle zoo. While we are confident that the electron remains fundamental, it is surrounded by a plethora of similar sounding terms, like leptons, hadrons, baryons, and mesons. Even though not every particle is considered fundamental, they all play a vital role in understanding the intricate structure of our universe. A fundamental particle is defined as a particle with no substructure and no finite size. According to the Standard Model, there are three types of fundamental particles: leptons, quarks, and carrier particles. As you may recall, carrier particles are responsible for transmitting fundamental forces between their interacting masses. Leptons are a group of six particles not bound by the strong nuclear force, of which the electron is one. As for quarks, they are the fundamental building blocks of a group of particles called hadrons, a group that includes both the proton and the neutron. Teacher Support [BL]It may be helpful to construct a graphical organizer, like a family tree, to show the relationship between various particles within the Standard Model. While this will eventually take place when the Standard Model is introduced, constructing a graphical organizer while moving through the unit will help provide structure to the students’ knowledge. Now for a brief history of quarks. Quarks were first proposed independently by American physicists Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig in 1963. Originally, three quark types—or flavors—were proposed with the names up (u), down (d), and strange (s). At first, physicists expected that, with sufficient energy, we should be able to free quarks and observe them directly. However, this has not proved possible, as the current understanding is that the force holding quarks together is incredibly great and, much like a spring, increases in magnitude as the quarks are separated. As a result, when large energies are put into collisions, other particles are created—but no quarks emerge. With that in mind, there is compelling evidence for the existence of quarks. By 1967, experiments at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory scattering 20-GeV electrons from protons produced results like Rutherford had obtained for the nucleus nearly 60 years earlier. The SLAC scattering experiments showed unambiguously that there were three point-like (meaning they had sizes considerably smaller than the probe’s wavelength) charges inside the proton as seen in . This evidence made all but the most skeptical admit that there was validity to the quark substructure of hadrons. Teacher Support Students should reflect on the idea that quarks have not been observed directly. Help them recognize that the lack of direct evidence does not mean that the evidence for quarks is weak. As will be seen in the discussion on fractional charge and color, the reason an individual quark has not been exposed may be more complex than expected. Scattering of high-energy electrons from protons at facilities like SLAC produces evidence of three point-like charges consistent with proposed quark properties. This experiment is analogous to Rutherford’s discovery of the small size of the nucleus by scattering α particles. High-energy electrons are used so that the probe wavelength is small enough to see details smaller than the proton. The inclusion of the strange quark with Zweig and Gell-Mann’s model concerned physicists. While the up and down quarks demonstrated fairly clear symmetry and were present in common fundamental particles like protons and neutrons, the strange quark did not have a counterpart of its own. This thought, coupled with the four known leptons at the time, caused scientists to predict that a fourth quark, yet to be found, also existed. In 1974, two groups of physicists independently discovered a particle with this new quark, labeled charmed. This completed the second exotic quark pair, strange (s) and charmed (c). A final pair of quarks was proposed when a third pair of leptons was discovered in 1975. The existence of the bottom (b) quark and the top (t) quark was verified through experimentation in 1976 and 1995, respectively. While it may seem odd that so much time would elapse between the original quark discovery in 1967 and the verification of the top quark in 1995, keep in mind that each quark discovered had a progressively larger mass. As a result, each new quark has required more energy to discover. Note that a very important tenet of science occurred throughout the period of quark discovery. The charmed, bottom, and top quarks were all speculated on, and then were discovered some time later. Each of their discoveries helped to verify and strengthen the quark model. This process of speculation and verification continues to take place today and is part of what drives physicists to search for evidence of the graviton and Grand Unified Theory. One of the most confounding traits of quarks is their electric charge. Long assumed to be discrete, and specifically a multiple of the elementary charge of the electron, the electric charge of an individual quark is fractional and thus seems to violate a presumed tenet of particle physics. The fractional charge of quarks, which are ±( 2 3 ) q e and ±( 1 3 ) q e , are the only structures found in nature with a nonintegral number of charge q . However, note that despite this odd construction, the fractional value of the quark does not violate the quantum nature of the charge. After all, free quarks cannot be found in nature, and all quarks are bound into arrangements in which an integer number of charge is constructed. shows the six known quarks, in addition to their antiquark components, as will be discussed later in this section. Quarks and Antiquarks Flavor Symbol Antiparticle Charge[1][2] [1]The lower of the ± symbols are the values for antiquarks. [2]There are further qualities that differentiate between quarks. However, they are beyond the discussion in this text. Up u u ¯ ± 2 3 q e Down d d ¯ ∓ 1 3 q e Strange s s ¯ ∓ 1 3 q e Charmed c c ¯ ± 2 3 q e Bottom b b ¯ ∓ 1 3 q e Top t t ¯ ± 2 3 q e While the term flavor is used to differentiate between types of quarks, the concept of color is more analogous to the electric charge in that it is primarily responsible for the force interactions between quarks. Note—Take a moment to think about the electrostatic force. It is the electric charge that causes attraction and repulsion. It is the same case here but with a color charge. The three colors available to a quark are red, green, and blue, with antiquarks having colors of anti-red (or cyan), anti-green (or magenta), and anti-blue (or yellow). Why use colors when discussing quarks? After all, the quarks are not actually colored with visible light. The reason colors are used is because the properties of a quark are analogous to the three primary and secondary colors mentioned above. Just as different colors of light can be combined to create white, different colors of quark may be combined to construct a particle like a proton or neutron. In fact, for each hadron, the quarks must combine such that their color sums to white! Recall that two up quarks and one down quark construct a proton, as seen in . The sum of the three quarks’ colors—red, green, and blue—yields the color white. This theory of color interaction within particles is called quantum chromodynamics, or QCD. As part of QCD, the strong nuclear force can be explained using color. In fact, some scientists refer to the color force, not the strong force, as one of the four fundamental forces. is a Feynman diagram showing the interaction between two quarks by using the transmission of a colored gluon. Note that the gluon is also considered the charge carrier for the strong nuclear force. Teacher Support [BL][OL]Review color theory with students to help them understand the usefulness of the color concept. When combined, what three colors create a white quark? When combined what three anticolors create a white antiquark? How does the combination of a color and anticolor create a white quark? Furthermore, move slowly through . Why does the down quark turn from red to green? Why does this cause the strange quark to turn from green to red? What color is the gluon? Is color conserved in this interaction? The exchange of gluons between quarks carries the strong force and may change the color of the interacting quarks. While the colors of the individual quarks change, their flavors do not. Note that quark flavor may have any color. For instance, in , the down quark has a red color and a green color. In other words, colors are not specific to a particle quark flavor. Hadrons and LeptonsParticles can be revealingly grouped according to what forces they feel between them. All particles (even those that are massless) are affected by gravity since gravity affects the space and time in which particles exist. All charged particles are affected by the electromagnetic force, as are neutral particles that have an internal distribution of charge (such as the neutron with its magnetic moment). Special names are given to particles that feel the strong and weak nuclear forces. Hadrons are particles that feel the strong nuclear force, whereas leptons are particles that do not. All particles feel the weak nuclear force. This means that hadrons are distinguished by being able to feel both the strong and weak nuclear forces. Leptons and hadrons are distinguished in other ways as well. Leptons are fundamental particles that have no measurable size, while hadrons are composed of quarks and have a diameter on the order of 10–15 m. Six particles, including the electron and neutrino, make up the list of known leptons. There are hundreds of complex particles in the hadron class, a few of which (including the proton and neutron) are listed in .List of Leptons and Hadrons.

The purpose of trying to uncover the smallest indivisible things in existence is to explain the world around us through forces and the interactions between particles, galaxies and objects. This is why a handful of scientists devote their life’s work to smashing together small particles. Teacher Support As a review of the four fundamental forces, place a particle on the board and have students identify which forces interact with it (electron: gravity, electromagnetic, weak; proton: all four). Then show that the electron is a type of lepton, while a proton is a type of hadron. Now have the students identify what forces act on the broad categories of particles of hadrons and leptons. Note that this concept will be reinforced during discussion of the Standard Model. What internal structure makes a proton so different from an electron? The proton, like all hadrons, is made up of quarks. A few examples of hadron quark composition can be seen in . As shown, each hadron is constructed of multiple quarks. As mentioned previously, the fractional quark charge in all four hadrons sums to the particle’s integral value. Also, notice that the color composition for each of the four particles adds to white. Each of the particles shown is constructed of up, down, and their antiquarks. This is not surprising, as the quarks strange, charmed, top, and bottom are found in only our most exotic particles. All baryons, such as the proton and neutron shown here, are composed of three quarks. All mesons, such as the pions shown here, are composed of a quarkantiquark pair. Arrows represent the spins of the quarks. The colors are such that they need to add to white for any possible combination of quarks. You may have noticed that while the proton and neutron in are composed of three quarks, both pions are comprised of only two quarks. This refers to a final delineation in particle structure. Particles with three quarks are called baryons. These are heavy particles that can decay into another baryon. Particles with only two quarks—a-quarkanti-quark pair—are called mesons. These are particles of moderate mass that cannot decay into the more massive baryons. Before continuing, take a moment to view . In this figure, you can see the strong force reimagined as a color force. The particles interacting in this figure are the proton and neutron, just as they were in . This reenvisioning of the strong force as an interaction between colored quarks is the critical concept behind quantum chromodynamics. This Feynman diagram shows the interaction between a proton and a neutron, corresponding to the interaction shown in . This diagram, however, shows the quark and gluon details of the strong nuclear force interaction. Matter and Antimatter Antimatter was first discovered in the form of the positron, the positively charged electron. In 1932, American physicist Carl Anderson discovered the positron in cosmic ray studies. Through a cloud chamber modified to curve the trajectories of cosmic rays, Anderson noticed that the curves of some particles followed that of a negative charge, while others curved like a positive charge. However, the positive curve showed not the mass of a proton but the mass of an electron. This outcome is shown in and suggests the existence of a positively charged version of the electron, created by the destruction of solar photons. The image above is from the Fermilab 15 foot bubble chamber and shows the production of an electron and positron (or antielectron) from an incident photon. This event is titled pair production and provides evidence of antimatter, as the two repel each other. Antimatter is considered the opposite of matter. For most antiparticles, this means that they share the same properties as their original particles with the exception of their charge. This is why the positron can be considered a positive electron while the antiproton is considered a negative proton. The idea of an opposite charge for neutral particles (like the neutron) can be confusing, but it makes sense when considered from the quark perspective. Just as the neutron is composed of one up quark and two down quarks (of charge + 2 3 and - 1 3 , respectively), the antineutron is composed of one antiup quark and two antidown quarks (of charge - 2 3 and + 1 3 , respectively). While the overall charge of the neutron remains the same, its constituent particles do not!A word about antiparticles: Like regular particles, antiparticles could function just fine on their own. In fact, a universe made up of antimatter may operate just as our own matter-based universe does. However, we do not know fully whether this is the case. The reason for this is annihilation. Annihilation is the process of destruction that occurs when a particle and its antiparticle interact. As soon as two particles (like a positron and an electron) coincide, they convert their masses to energy through the equation E=m c 2 . This mass-to-energy conversion, which typically results in photon release, happens instantaneously and makes it very difficult for scientists to study antimatter. That said, scientists have had success creating antimatter through high-energy particle collisions. Both antineutrons and antiprotons were created through accelerator experiments in 1956, and an antihydrogen atom was even created at CERN in 1995! As referenced in , the annihilation of antiparticles is currently used in medical studies to determine the location of radioisotopes. Teacher Support [AL]What would have occurred in the Big Bang if the numbers of matter and antimatter were the same? Students may likely be curious about why there is more matter than antimatter in the universe. Advanced students can be pointed toward research into charge parity violation. Completing the Standard Model of the AtomThe Standard Model of the atom refers to the current scientific view of the fundamental components and interacting forces of matter. The Standard Model () shows the six quarks that bind to form all hadrons, the six lepton particles already considered fundamental, the four carrier particles (or gauge bosons) that transmit forces between the leptons and quarks, and the recently added Higgs boson (which will be discussed shortly). This totals 17 fundamental particles, combinations of which are responsible for all known matter in our entire universe! When adding the antiquarks and antileptons, 31 components make up the Standard Model. The Standard Model of elementary particles shows an organized view of all fundamental particles, as currently known: six quarks, six leptons, and four gauge bosons (or carrier particles). The Higgs boson, first observed in 2012, is a new addition to the Standard Model. shows all particles within the Standard Model of the atom. Not only does this chart divide all known particles by color-coded group, but it also provides information on particle stability. Note that the color-coding system in this chart is separate from the red, green, and blue color labeling system of quarks. The first three columns represent the three families of matter. The first column, considered Family 1, represents particles that make up normal matter, constructing the protons, neutrons, and electrons that make up the common world. Family 2, represented from the charm quark to the muon neutrino, is comprised of particles that are more massive. The leptons in this group are less stable and more likely to decay. Family 3, represented by the third column, are more massive still and decay more quickly. The order of these families also conveniently represents the order in which these particles were discovered. Look for trends that exist within the Standard Model. Compare the charge of each particle. Compare the spin. How does mass relate to the model structure? Recognizing each of these trends and asking questions will yield more insight into the organization of particles and the forces that dictate particle relationships. Our understanding of the Standard Model is still young, and the questions you may have in analyzing the Standard Model may be some of the same questions that particle physicists are searching for answers to today! The Standard Model also summarizes the fundamental forces that exist as particles interact. A closer look at the Standard Model, as shown in , reveals that the arrangement of carrier particles describes these interactions. The revised Standard Model shows the interaction between gauge bosons and other fundamental particles. These interactions are responsible for the fundamental forces, three of which are described through the chart’s shaded areas. Each of the shaded areas represents a fundamental force and its constituent particles. The red shaded area shows all particles involved in the strong nuclear force, which we now know is due to quantum chromodynamics. The blue shaded area corresponds to the electromagnetic force, while the green shaded area corresponds to the weak nuclear force, which affects all quarks and leptons. The electromagnetic force and weak nuclear force are considered united by the electroweak force within the Standard Model. Also, because definitive evidence of the graviton is yet to be found, it is not included in the Standard Model. The Higgs Boson One interesting feature of the Standard Model shown in is that, while the gluon and photon have no mass, the Z and W bosons are very massive. What supplies these quickly moving particles with mass and not the gluons and photons? Furthermore, what causes some quarks to have more mass than others? In the 1960s, British physicist Peter Higgs and others speculated that the W and Z bosons were actually just as massless as the gluon and photon. However, as the W and Z bosons traveled from one particle to another, they were slowed down by the presence of a Higgs field, much like a fish swimming through water. The thinking was that the existence of the Higgs field would slow down the bosons, causing them to decrease in energy and thereby transfer this energy to mass. Under this theory, all particles pass through the Higgs field, which exists throughout the universe. The gluon and photon travel through this field as well but are able to do so unaffected. The presence of a force from the Higgs field suggests the existence of its own carrier particle, the Higgs boson. This theorized boson interacts with all particles but gluons and photons, transferring force from the Higgs field. Particles with large mass (like the top quark) are more likely to receive force from the Higgs boson. While it is difficult to examine a field, it is somewhat simpler to find evidence of its carrier. On July 4, 2012, two groups of scientists at the LHC independently confirmed the existence of a Higgs-like particle. By examining trillions of proton–proton collisions at energies of 7 to 8 TeV, LHC scientists were able to determine the constituent particles that created the protons. In this data, scientists found a particle with similar mass, spin, parity, and interactions with other particles that matched the Higgs boson predicted decades prior. On March 13, 2013, the existence of the Higgs boson was tentatively confirmed by CERN. Peter Higgs and Francois Englert received the Nobel Prize in 2013 for the “theoretical discovery of a mechanism that contributes to our understanding of the origin and mass of subatomic particles.” Teacher Support Reinforce to students that the identification of the Higgs particle was similar to the process used to find evidence of many fundamental particles. Contrast this process with the indirect process used to locate the individual quark. Particle Physicist If you have an innate desire to unravel life’s great mysteries and further understand the nature of the physical world, a career in particle physics may be for you! Particle physicists have played a critical role in much of society’s technological progress. From lasers to computers, televisions to space missions, splitting the atom to understanding the DNA molecule to MRIs and PET scans, much of our modern society is based on the work done by particle physicists. While many particle physicists focus on specialized tasks in the fields of astronomy and medicine, the main goal of particle physics is to further scientists’ understanding of the Standard Model. This may mean work in government, industry, or academics. Within the government, jobs in particle physics can be found within the National Institute for Standards and Technology, Department of Energy, NASA, and Department of Defense. Both the electronics and computer industries rely on the expertise of particle physicists. College teaching and research positions can also be potential career opportunities for particle physicists, though they often require some postgraduate work as a prerequisite. In addition, many particle physicists are employed to work on high-energy colliders. Domestic collider labs include the Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York, the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory near Chicago, and the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory operated by Stanford University. For those who like to travel, work at international collider labs can be found at the CERN facility in Switzerland in addition to institutes like the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics in Russia, DESY in Germany, and KEK in Japan. Shirley Jackson became the first African American woman to earn a Ph.D. from MIT back in 1973, and she went on to lead a highly successful career in the field of particle physics. Like Dr. Jackson, successful students of particle physics grow up with a strong curiosity in the world around them and a drive to continually learn more. If you are interested in exploring a career in particle physics, work to achieve good grades and SAT scores, and find time to read popular books on physics topics that interest you. While some math may be challenging, recognize that this is only a tool of physics and should not be considered prohibitive to the field. High-level work in particle physics often requires a Ph.D.; however, it is possible to find work with a master’s degree. Additionally, jobs in industry and teaching can be achieved with solely an undergraduate degree.

In what particle were quarks originally discovered? the electron the neutron the proton the photon Does antimatter exist? no yes What fundamental property is provided by particle interaction with the Higgs boson? charge mass spin color What particles were launched into the proton during the original discovery of the quark? bosons electrons neutrons photons Section Summary There are three types of fundamental particles—leptons, quarks, and carrier particles. Quarks come in six flavors and three colors and occur only in combinations that produce white. Hadrons are thought to be composed of quarks, with baryons having three quarks and mesons having a quark and an antiquark. Known particles can be divided into three major groups—leptons, hadrons, and carrier particles (gauge bosons). All particles of matter have an antimatter counterpart that has the opposite charge and certain other quantum numbers. These matterantimatter pairs are otherwise very similar but will annihilate when brought together. The strong force is carried by eight proposed particles called gluons, which are intimately connected to a quantum number called color—their governing theory is thus called quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Taken together, QCD and the electroweak theory are widely accepted as the Standard Model of particle physics. Concept Items How does the charge of an individual quark determine hadron structure? Since the hadron must have an integral value, the individual quarks must be combined such that the average of their charges results in the value of a quark. Since the hadron must have an integral value, the individual atoms must be combined such that the sum of their charges is less than zero. The individual quarks must be combined such that the product of their charges is equal to the total charge of the hadron structure. Since the hadron must have an integral value of charge, the individual quarks must be combined such that the sum of their charges results in an integral value. Why do leptons not feel the strong nuclear force? Gluons are the carriers of the strong nuclear force that interacts between quarks through color interactions, but leptons are constructed of quarks that do not have gluons. Gluons are the carriers of the strong nuclear force that interacts between quarks through mass interactions, but leptons are not constructed of quarks and are not massive. Gluons are the carriers of the strong nuclear force that interacts between quarks through mass interactions, but leptons are constructed of the quarks that are not massive. Gluons are the carriers of the strong nuclear force that interacts between quarks through color interactions, but leptons are not constructed of quarks, nor do they have color constituents. What property commonly distinguishes antimatter from its matter analogue? mass charge energy speed Can the Standard Model change as new information is gathered? yes no What is the relationship between the Higgs field and the Higgs boson? The Higgs boson is the carrier that transfers force for the Higgs field. The Higgs field is the time duration over which the Higgs particles transfer force to the other particles. The Higgs field is the magnitude of momentum transferred by the Higgs particles to the other particles. The Higgs field is the magnitude of torque transfers by the Higgs particles on the other particles. What were the original three flavors of quarks discovered? up, down, and charm up, down, and bottom up, down, and strange up, down, and top Protons are more massive than electrons. The three quarks in the proton account for only a small amount of this mass difference. What accounts for the remaining excess mass in protons compared to electrons? The highly energetic gluons connecting the quarks account for the remaining excess mass in protons compared to electrons. The highly energetic photons connecting the quarks account for the remaining excess mass in protons compared to electrons. The antiparallel orientation of the quarks present in a proton accounts for the remaining excess mass in protons compared to electrons. The parallel orientation of the quarks present in a proton accounts for the remaining excess mass in protons compared to electrons. Critical Thinking Why are mesons considered unstable? Mesons are composites of two antiparticles that quickly annihilate each other. Mesons are composites of two particles that quickly annihilate each other. Mesons are composites of a particle and antiparticle that quickly annihilate each other. Mesons are composites of two particles and one antiparticle that quickly annihilate each other. Does antimatter have a negative mass? No, antimatter does not have a negative mass. Yes, antimatter does have a negative mass. How were particle collisions used to provide evidence of the Higgs boson? Because some particles do not contain the Higgs boson, the collisions of such particles will cause their destruction. Because only the charged particles contain the Higgs boson, the collisions of such particles will cause their destruction and will expel the Higgs boson. Because all particles with mass contain the Higgs boson, the collisions of such particles will cause their destruction and will absorb the Higgs boson. Because all particles with mass contain the Higgs boson, the collisions of such particles will cause their destruction and will expel the Higgs boson. Explain how the combination of a quark and antiquark can result in the creation of a hadron. The combination of a quark and antiquark can result in a particle with an integer charge and color of white, therefore satisfying the properties for a hadron. The combination of a quark and antiquark must result in a particle with a negative charge and color of white, therefore satisfying the properties for a hadron. The combination of a quark and antiquark can result in a particle with an integer charge and color that is not white, therefore satisfying the properties for a hadron. The combination of a quark and antiquark can result in particle with a fractional charge and color that is not white, therefore satisfying the properties for a hadron.

Which particles in the Standard Model account for the majority of matter with which we are familiar? particles in fourth column of the Standard Model particles in third column of the Standard Model particles in the second column of the Standard Model particles in the first column of the Standard Model Test Prep Extended Response In this image, how does the emission of the gluon cause the down quark to change from a red color to a green color? The emitted red gluon is made up of a green and a red color. As a result, the down quark changes from a red color to a green color. The emitted red gluon is made up of an anti-green and an anti-red color. As a result, the down quark changes from a red color to a green color. The emitted red gluon is made up of a green and an anti-red color. As a result, the down quark changes from a red color to a green color. The emitted red gluon is made up of an anti-green and a red color. As a result, the down quark changes from a red color to a green color. Neutrinos are much more difficult for scientists to find when compared to other hadrons and leptons. Why is this? Neutrinos are hadrons, and they lack charge. Neutrinos are not hadrons, and they lack charge. Neutrinos are hadrons, and they have positive charge. Neutrinos are not hadrons, and they have a positive charge. The term force carrier particle is shorthand for the scientific term vector gauge boson. From that perspective, can the Higgs boson truly be considered a force carrier particle? No, the mass quality provided by the Higgs boson is a scalar quantity. Yes, the mass quality provided by the Higgs boson results in a change of particles direction. annihilation the process of destruction that occurs when a particle and antiparticle interact antimatter matter constructed of antiparticles; antimatter shares most of the same properties of regular matter, with charge being the only difference between many particles and their antiparticle analogues baryon hadrons that always decay to another baryon bottom quark a quark flavor charmed quark a quark flavor, which is the counterpart of the strange quark color a property of quarks the relates to their interactions through the strong force down quark the second lightest of all quarks flavor quark type gluons exchange particles of the nuclear strong force hadron particles composed of quarks that feel the strong and weak nuclear force Higgs boson a massive particle that provides mass to the weak bosons and provides validity to the theory that carrier particles are identical under certain circumstances Higgs field the field through which all fundamental particles travel that provides them varying mass through the transport of the Higgs boson lepton fundamental particles that do not feel the nuclear strong force meson hadrons that can decay to leptons and leave no hadrons pair production the creation of a particle and antiparticle, commonly an electron and positron, due to the annihilation of a photon positron a particle of antimatter that has the properties of a positively charged electron quantum chromodynamics the theory of color interaction between quarks that leads to understanding of the nuclear strong force quark an elementary particle and fundamental constituent of matter that is a substructure of hadrons Standard Model an organization of fundamental particles and forces that is a result of quantum chromodynamics and electroweak theory strange quark the third lightest of all quarks top quark a quark flavor up quark the lightest of all quarks", "formulas": [], "subsections": [], "extraction_stats": {"chapters_found": 23, "text_length": 1895072, "modules_processed": 98}, "content_hash": "93f89c3db3e2c9ab6f8204866c429cdc", "section_index": 2, "total_sections": 4}

The student knows the nature of forces in the physical world. The student is expected to: (H) describe evidence for and effects of the strong and weak nuclear forces in nature. Section Key Terms Big Bang Electroweak Epoch electroweak theory Grand Unification Epoch Grand Unified Theory Inflationary Epoch Planck Epoch Quark Era superforce Theory of Everything Understanding the Grand Unified TheoryPresent quests to show that the four basic forces are different manifestations of a single unified force that follow a long tradition. In the nineteenth century, the distinct electric and magnetic forces were shown to be intimately connected and are now collectively called the electromagnetic force. More recently, the weak nuclear force was united with the electromagnetic force. As shown in , carrier particles transmit three of the four fundamental forces in very similar ways. With these considerations in mind, it is natural to suggest that a theory may be constructed in which the strong nuclear, weak nuclear, and electromagnetic forces are all unified. The search for a correct theory linking the forces, called the Grand Unified Theory (GUT), is explored in this section. In the 1960s, the electroweak theory was developed by Steven Weinberg, Sheldon Glashow, and Abdus Salam. This theory proposed that the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces are identical at sufficiently high energies. At lower energies, like those in our present-day universe, the two forces remain united but manifest themselves in different ways. One of the main consequences of the electroweak theory was the prediction of three short-range carrier particles, now known as the W + , W − , and Z 0 bosons. Not only were three particles predicted, but the mass of each W + and W − boson was predicted to be 81 GeV/c2, and that of the Z 0 boson was predicted to be 90 GeV/c2. In 1983, these carrier particles were observed at CERN with the predicted characteristics, including masses having those predicted values as given in .How can forces be unified? They are definitely distinct under most circumstances. For example, they are carried by different particles and have greatly different strengths. But experiments show that at extremely short distances and at extremely high energies, the strengths of the forces begin to become more similar, as seen in . The exchange of a virtual Z 0 particle (boson) carries the weak nuclear force between an electron and a neutrino in this Feynman diagram. This diagram is similar to the diagrams in and for the electromagnetic and strong nuclear forces. As discussed earlier, the short ranges and large masses of the weak carrier bosons require correspondingly high energies to create them. Thus, the energy scale on the horizontal axis of also corresponds to shorter and shorter distances (going from left to right), with 100 GeV corresponding to approximately 10−18 m, for example. At that distance, the strengths of the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces are the same. To test this, energies of about 100 GeV are put into the system. When this occurs, the W + , W − , and Z 0 carrier particles are created and released. At those and higher energies, the masses of the carrier particles become less and less relevant, and the Z 0 boson in particular resembles the massless, chargeless photon. As further energy is added, the W + , W − , and Z 0 particles are further transformed into massless carrier particles even more similar to photons and gluons. Teacher Support [BL][OL][AL]Given the discussion in the prior paragraph, what should scientists expect to see as they probe the Grand Unified Theory? What characteristics should the gluon have at this energy? The relative strengths of the four basic forces vary with distance, and, hence, energy is needed to probe small distances. At ordinary energies (a few eV or less), the forces differ greatly. However, at energies available in accelerators, the weak nuclear and electromagnetic (EM) forces become unified. Unfortunately, the energies at which the strong nuclear and electroweak forces become the same are unreachable in any conceivable accelerator. The universe may provide a laboratory, and nature may show effects at ordinary energies that give us clues about the validity of this graph. The extremely short distances and high energies at which the electroweak force becomes identical with the strong nuclear force are not reachable with any conceivable human-built accelerator. At energies of about 1014 GeV (16,000 J per particle), distances of about 10–30 m can be probed. Such energies are needed to test the theory directly, but these are about 1010 times higher than the maximum energy associated with the LHC, and the distances are about 1012 smaller than any structure we have direct knowledge of. This would be the realm of various GUTs, of which there are many, since there is no constraining evidence at these energies and distances. Past experience has shown that anytime you probe so many orders of magnitude further, you find the unexpected.While direct evidence of a GUT is not presently possible, that does not rule out the ability to assess a GUT through an indirect process. Current GUTs require various other events as a consequence of their theory. Some GUTs require the existence of magnetic monopoles, very massive individual north- and south-pole particles, which have not yet been proven to exist, while others require the use of extra dimensions. However, not all theories result in the same consequences. For example, disproving the existence of magnetic monopoles will not disprove all GUTs. Much of the science we accept in our everyday lives is based on different models, each with their own strengths and limitations. Although a particular model may have drawbacks, that does not necessarily mean that it should be discounted completely. One consequence of GUTs that can theoretically be assessed is proton decay. Multiple current GUTs hypothesize that the stable proton should actually decay at a lifetime of 1031 years. While this time is incredibly large (keep in mind that the age of the universe is less than 14 billion years), scientists at the Super-Kamiokande in Japan have used a 50,000-ton tank of water to search for its existence. The decay of a single proton in the Super-Kamiokande tank would be observed by a detector, thereby providing support for the predicting GUT model. However, as of 2014, 17 years into the experiment, decay is yet to be found. This time span equates to a minimum limit on proton life of 5.9× 10 33 years. While this result certainly does not support many grand unifying theories, an acceptable model may still exist. The Super-Kamiokande experiment is a clever use of proportional reasoning. Because it is not feasible to test for 1031 years in order for a single proton to decay, scientists chose instead to manipulate the protontime ratio. If one proton decays in 1031 years, then in one year 10−31 protons will decay. With this in mind, if scientists wanted to test the proton decay theory in one year, they would need 1031 protons. While this is also unfeasible, the use of a 50,000-ton tank of water helps to bring both the wait time and proton number to within reason. The Standard Model and the Big BangNature is full of examples where the macroscopic and microscopic worlds intertwine. Newton realized that the nature of gravity on Earth that pulls an apple to the ground could explain the motion of the moon and planets so much farther away. Decays of tiny nuclei explain the hot interior of the Earth. Fusion of nuclei likewise explains the energy of stars. Today, the patterns in particle physics seem to be explaining the evolution and character of the universe. And the nature of the universe has implications for unexplored regions of particle physics. In 1929, Edwin Hubble observed that all but the closest galaxies surrounding our own had a red shift in their hydrogen spectra that was proportional to their distance from us. Applying the Doppler Effect, Hubble recognized that this meant that all galaxies were receding from our own, with those farther away receding even faster. Knowing that our place in the universe was no more unique than any other, the implication was clear: The space within the universe itself was expanding. Just like pen marks on an expanding balloon, everything in the universe was accelerating away from everything else. Teacher Support [BL][OL][AL]Modeling the Big Bang through an expanding balloon is a good demonstration to show that our perspective on the universe is not unique, that all places are expanding equally from all others, and to provide basis for the Big Bang. This will also be useful to help students understand that while parts of the universe may be expanding from us at speeds greater than the speed of light, they are not violating relativity. shows how the recession of galaxies looks like the remnants of a gigantic explosion, the famous Big Bang. Extrapolating backward in time, the Big Bang would have occurred between 13 and 15 billion years ago, when all matter would have been at a single point. From this, questions instantly arise. What caused the explosion? What happened before the Big Bang? Was there a before, or did time start then? For our purposes, the biggest question relating to the Big Bang is this: How does the Big Bang relate to the unification of the fundamental forces? Galaxies are flying apart from one another, with the more distant ones moving faster, as if a primordial explosion expelled the matter from which they formed. The most distant known galaxies move nearly at the speed of light relative to us. To fully understand the conditions of the very early universe, recognize that as the universe contracts to the size of the Big Bang, changes will occur. The density and temperature of the universe will increase dramatically. As particles become closer together, they will become too close to exist as we know them. The high energies will create other, more unusual particles to exist in greater abundance. Knowing this, let’s move forward from the start of the universe, beginning with the Big Bang, as illustrated in . The evolution of the universe from the Big Bang onward (from left to right) is intimately tied to the laws of physics, especially those of particle physics at the earliest stages. Theories of the unification of forces at high energies may be verified by their shaping of the universe and its evolution. Teacher Support The discussion of the universe evolution in this text stops at the Quark Era. Have students consider why various other eras took place after the Quark Era. How did temperature, density, and pressure play a role in further evolution? The Planck Epoch ( 0→ 10 −43 s ) —Though scientists are unable to model the conditions of the Planck Epoch in the laboratory, speculation is that at this time compressed energy was great enough to reach the immense 10 19 GeV necessary to unify gravity with all other forces. As a result, modern cosmology suggests that all four forces would have existed as one force, a hypothetical superforce as suggested by the Theory of Everything.The Grand Unification Epoch ( 10 −43 → 10 −36 s ) —As the universe expands, the temperatures necessary to maintain the superforce decrease. As a result, gravity separates, leaving the electroweak and strong nuclear forces together. At this time, the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces are identical, matching the conditions requested in the Grand Unification Theory.The Inflationary Epoch ( 10 −36 → 10 −32 s ) —The separation of the strong nuclear force from the electroweak force during this time is thought to have been responsible for the massive inflation of the universe. Corresponding to the steep diagonal line on the left side of , the universe may have expanded by a factor of 10 50 or more in size. In fact, the expansion was so great during this time that it actually occurred faster than the speed of light! Unfortunately, there is little hope that we may be able to test the inflationary scenario directly since it occurs at energies near 10 14 GeV, vastly greater than the limits of modern accelerators.The Electroweak Epoch ( 10 −32 → 10 −11 s ) —Now separated from both gravity and the strong nuclear force, the electroweak force exists as a singular force during this time period. As stated earlier, scientists are able to create the energies at this stage in the universe’s expansion, needing only 100 GeV, as shown in . W and Z bosons, as well as the Higgs boson, are released during this time.The Quark Era ( 10 −11 → 10 −6 s ) —During the Quark Era, the universe has expanded and temperatures have decreased to the point at which all four fundamental forces have separated. Additionally, quarks began to take form as energies decreased.As the universe expanded, further eras took place, allowing for the existence of hadrons, leptons, and photons, the fundamental particles of the standard model. Eventually, in nucleosynthesis, nuclei would be able to form, and the basic building blocks of atomic matter could take place. Using particle accelerators, we are very much working backwards in an attempt to understand the universe. It is encouraging to see that the macroscopic conditions of the Big Bang align nicely with our submicroscopic particle theory. Check Your Understanding Teacher Support Use these questions to assess student achievement of the section’s learning objectives. If students are struggling with a specific objective, these questions will help identify which and direct students to the relevant content. Is there one grand unified theory or multiple grand unifying theories? one grand unifying theory multiple grand unifying theories The existence of what particles were predicted as a consequence of the electroweak theory? fermions Higgs bosons leptons W+, W-, and Z0 bosons Section Summary Attempts to show unification of the four forces are called Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) and have been partially successful, with connections proven between EM and weak forces in electroweak theory. Unification of the strong force is expected at such high energies that it cannot be directly tested, but it may have observable consequences in the as-yet-unobserved decay of the proton. Although unification of forces is generally anticipated, much remains to be done to prove its validity. Concept Items Why are scientists unable to model the conditions of the universe at time periods shortly after the Big Bang? The amount of energy necessary to replicate the Planck Epoch is too high. The amount of energy necessary to replicate the Planck Epoch is too low. The volume of setup necessary to replicate the Planck Epoch is too high. The volume of setup necessary to replicate the Planck Epoch is too low. What is the name for the theory of unification of all four fundamental forces? the theory of everything the theory of energy-to-mass conversion the theory of relativity the theory of the Big Bang Critical Thinking If some unknown cause of the red shift, such as light becoming tired from traveling long distances through empty space, is discovered, what effect would there be on cosmology? The effect would be substantial, as the Big Bang is based on the idea that the red shift is evidence that galaxies are moving toward one another. The effect would be substantial, as the Big Bang is based on the idea that the red shift is evidence that the galaxies are moving away from one another. The effect would be substantial, as the Big Bang is based on the idea that the red shift is evidence that galaxies are neither moving away from nor moving toward one another. The effect would be substantial, as the Big Bang is based on the idea that the red shift is evidence that galaxies are sometimes moving away from and sometimes moving toward one another.

The electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces all have different Feynman diagrams. Test Prep Short Answer How does the search for the Grand Unified Theory help test the standard cosmological model? Scientists are increasing energy in the lab that models the energy in earlier, denser stages of the universe. Scientists are increasing energy in the lab that models the energy in earlier, less dense stages of the universe. Scientists are decreasing energy in the lab that models the energy in earlier, denser stages of the universe. Scientists are decreasing energy in the lab that models the energy in earlier, less dense stages of the universe. When accelerating elementary particles in a particle accelerator, they quickly achieve a speed approaching the speed of light. However, as time continues, the particles maintain this speed yet continue to increase their kinetic energy. How is this possible? The speed remains the same, but the masses of the particles increase. The speed remains the same, but the masses of the particles decrease. The speed remains the same, and the masses of the particles remain the same. The speed and masses will remain the same, but temperature will increase. Performance Task Teacher Support This performance task meets the following standard: NGSSHS-PS2-6. Communicate scientific and technical information about why the molecular-level structure is important in the functioning of designed materials. Communication is an often overlooked and useful skill for a scientist, especially in a competitive field where financial resources are limited. Scientists are often required to explain their findings or the relevance of their work to agencies within the government in order to maintain funding to continue their research. Let’s say you are an ambitious young particle physicist, heading an expensive project, and you need to justify its existence to the appropriate funding agency. Write a brief paper (about one page) explaining why molecular-level structure is important in the functioning of designed materials in a specific industry. First, think of an industry where molecular-level structure is important. Research what materials are used in that industry as well as what are the desired properties of the materials. What molecular-level characteristics lead to what properties? One example would be explaining how flexible but durable materials are made up of long-chained molecules and how this is useful for finding more environmentally friendly alternatives to plastics. Another example is explaining why electrically conductive materials are often made of metal and how this is useful for developing better batteries. Test Prep Extended Response If a Grand Unified Theory is proven and the four forces are unified, it will still be correct to say that the orbit of the Moon is determined by the gravitational force. Explain why. Gravity will not be a property of the unified force. Gravity will be one property of the unified force. Apart from gravity, no other force depends on the mass of the object. Apart from gravity, no other force can make an object move in a fixed orbit. As the universe expanded and temperatures dropped, the strong nuclear force separated from the electroweak force. Is it likely that under cooler conditions, the force of electricity will separate from the force of magnetism? No, the electric force relies on the magnetic force and vice versa. Yes, the electric and magnetic forces can be separated from each other.
